00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:10,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Morning, Scott.
- Morning, Vince.</font>

2
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:11,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Morning, Wells.
- Morning, sir.</font>

3
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:12,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

4
00:04:15,927 --> 00:04:17,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ghost Rider, this is Strike.</font>

5
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:19,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have unknown aircraft.</font>

6
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:20,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Inbound, Mustang.</font>

7
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:23,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your vector, 090 for bogey.</font>

8
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:34,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's up there?</font>

9
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:36,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar and Merlin
and Maverick and Goose.</font>

10
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:38,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great.</font>

11
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:40,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick and Goose.</font>

12
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:51,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talk to me, Goose.</font>

13
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:54,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roger, I got him.
Contact, 20 left at 30 miles.</font>

14
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:55,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">900 knots closure.</font>

15
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:58,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cougar, you hear that?
- Roger.</font>

16
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:02,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Merlin, you got him?
- Roger, I've got radar contact.</font>

17
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:04,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get a visual ID.
Cougar, you hook him.</font>

18
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:06,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roger, and I'll clean him and fry him.</font>

19
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:17,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mustang.
Mustang, this is Ghost Rider, 203.</font>

20
00:05:17,906 --> 00:05:21,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got him inbound,
bogey heading 270.</font>

21
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:23,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're at 10 miles, 900 knots closure.</font>

22
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:27,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ghost Rider, take angels 10 left, 30.</font>

23
00:05:27,374 --> 00:05:28,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we supposed to have visitors today?</font>

24
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:30,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Negative, sir.</font>

25
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:39,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Merlin, see if he's a single.
- Roger.</font>

26
00:05:42,305 --> 00:05:45,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Goose, you see a trailer?
- Negative, Merlin.</font>

27
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:47,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like he's a single.</font>

28
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:49,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar, I'm gonna go
head-to-head with him.</font>

29
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:52,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it easy, Maverick.
I don't like this shit.</font>

30
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:55,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna break high and right,
see if he's really alone.</font>

31
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got 1,000 knots closure, Mav.</font>

32
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:17,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's coming right at us.</font>

33
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:19,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, buddy, what's on your mind?</font>

34
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:23,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit, there's two of them.</font>

35
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:26,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MIG-28s.
No one's been this close before.</font>

36
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell are they doing here?
What's the position?</font>

37
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:31,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">200 and 50 miles out, sir.</font>

38
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:33,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">200 and 50 miles?
Get them out of here.</font>

39
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:38,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar, you've got MIG 1.
I'm going after MIG 2.</font>

40
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:41,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lost him in the sun.</font>

41
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:44,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. What's he doing?</font>

42
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:46,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got him, Merlin?</font>

43
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:50,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's coming around.
He's coming around on our tail.</font>

44
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it. This bogey's all over me.</font>

45
00:06:57,714 --> 00:06:59,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's their range now?</font>

46
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:00,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">200 miles, sir.</font>

47
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If they break 150 miles,</font>

48
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:04,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- launch the alert 5 aircraft.
- Yes, sir.</font>

49
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:08,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Air speed, 300. Go get him, Mav.</font>

50
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:10,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going for missile lock.</font>

51
00:07:11,144 --> 00:07:13,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see if we can scare
this guy out of here.</font>

52
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, lock up, baby.</font>

53
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lock up, baby. Lock up.</font>

54
00:07:19,277 --> 00:07:21,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got him locked. Bingo.</font>

55
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:29,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got him, Mav.
He's bugging out and going home.</font>

56
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:31,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mustang, this is Maverick.
MIG 2 is headed home.</font>

57
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, what's their position?</font>

58
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A hundred and 80 miles
at bearing 010, sir.</font>

59
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:43,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar, he's got missile lock on us.
Get away from this guy.</font>

60
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:45,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is this shit?
He's engaging me.</font>

61
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:50,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it, Mustang.
This is Ghost Rider,</font>

62
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:52,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">117, this bogey's all over me.</font>

63
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:54,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got missile lock on me.
Do I have permission to fire?</font>

64
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:56,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not fire until fired upon.</font>

65
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:00,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goose, there they are, right below us.</font>

66
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:04,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The MIG's in perfect firing position.
He's right on Cougar's tail.</font>

67
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:07,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way, Goose. He'd have fired by now.
He's just trying to piss us off.</font>

68
00:08:07,993 --> 00:08:10,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick, get down here
and get this asshole off me.</font>

69
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:14,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy, Cougar.</font>

70
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:20,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring it back, hard right.
Help me engage. I'm on my way.</font>

71
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:39,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't shoot this son of a bitch.</font>

72
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:41,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see if we can have
a little fun with him.</font>

73
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:48,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this your idea of fun, Mav?</font>

74
00:08:52,037 --> 00:08:53,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Greetings.</font>

75
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:57,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch the birdie.</font>

76
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:01,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez, I crack myself up.</font>

77
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:11,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a great shot, Mav.
I should be a photographer.</font>

78
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:13,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar,</font>

79
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:16,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your tail is clear. MIG 1's bugged out.</font>

80
00:09:26,362 --> 00:09:28,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar, this is Maverick.</font>

81
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:31,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've had enough fun
for one day, don't you think?</font>

82
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:33,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm getting a little low on fuel,</font>

83
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:34,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so we're heading home.</font>

84
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll see you on deck.</font>

85
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:51,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar, we're running low on gas,
we gotta get out of here.</font>

86
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:55,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar.</font>

87
00:09:57,602 --> 00:09:59,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're on vapor, Cougar.</font>

88
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:01,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do it.</font>

89
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:04,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar. Come on, Cougar.</font>

90
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:16,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's take it back to the ship, man.</font>

91
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:18,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Cougar.</font>

92
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:20,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him on deck as soon as possible.
He's gotta be low on fuel.</font>

93
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:26,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar, we gotta land this thing.
We are way low on gas.</font>

94
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:27,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand me?</font>

95
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all right, man?</font>

96
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:39,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick, you're at 3-quarters
of a mile, call the ball.</font>

97
00:10:40,436 --> 00:10:42,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roger. Maverick has the ball.</font>

98
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cougar, it is time to land. Let's do it.
- Goose, Cougar's in trouble.</font>

99
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:49,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Mav,
we're getting low on gas.</font>

100
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's land this sucker.</font>

101
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar!</font>

102
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it, Maverick.</font>

103
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What're you doing, Mav?
We've got no fuel for this.</font>

104
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:05,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going after Cougar.</font>

105
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:09,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tell him to land that plane.
That's an order.</font>

106
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:12,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ghost Rider, you are instructed to land.</font>

107
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Land immediately.</font>

108
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:21,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any of you boys seen
an aircraft carrier around here?</font>

109
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:24,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mav, we got a little problem up here.</font>

110
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:28,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That MIG really screwed him up.
I don't think he can make it back.</font>

111
00:11:31,362 --> 00:11:34,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're okay, Cougar.
Just stay on my wing,</font>

112
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:36,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take you all the way in.</font>

113
00:11:36,534 --> 00:11:37,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just stay with me.</font>

114
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:55,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy, Cougar.
Just a walk in the park, buddy.</font>

115
00:11:57,222 --> 00:12:00,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a little low.
You're a little low, Coug.</font>

116
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, buddy, pull up.</font>

117
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:06,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull up, Cougar.</font>

118
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:10,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it. Almost there.</font>

119
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:15,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar, you're well below glide path,
3-quarters of a mile. Call the ball.</font>

120
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:18,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roger, ball.</font>

121
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:29,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're too low, Cougar.</font>

122
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:31,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're too low, Cougar.</font>

123
00:12:31,673 --> 00:12:34,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Increase power. Some more power!</font>

124
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Higher! Higher! Higher, damn it!</font>

125
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:47,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come in.</font>

126
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:51,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>

127
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar, you should be in sickbay.
What's on your mind?</font>

128
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My wife and kid, sir.</font>

129
00:12:57,615 --> 00:13:00,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I almost orphaned him today,
and I've never even seen him.</font>

130
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:05,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what happened
up there, but I was so scared.</font>

131
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:09,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, we've seen this before.
- No, sir.</font>

132
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:12,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm holding on too tight.</font>

133
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've lost the edge.</font>

134
00:13:15,091 --> 00:13:16,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, sir.</font>

135
00:13:18,303 --> 00:13:19,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

136
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:27,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar.</font>

137
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:31,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Maverick.</font>

138
00:13:34,485 --> 00:13:36,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick, Goose, come in here.</font>

139
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:39,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.</font>

140
00:13:40,742 --> 00:13:41,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

141
00:13:46,247 --> 00:13:48,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick, you just did
an incredibly brave thing.</font>

142
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you should have done
was land your plane.</font>

143
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:57,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't own that plane,
the taxpayers do.</font>

144
00:13:57,842 --> 00:14:00,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son, your ego is writing checks
your body can't cash.</font>

145
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:02,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've been busted.</font>

146
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:05,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lost your qualifications
as section leader 3 times.</font>

147
00:14:06,017 --> 00:14:08,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put in hack twice by me.</font>

148
00:14:08,603 --> 00:14:10,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With a history of high-speed passes</font>

149
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:13,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over 5 air-control towers</font>

150
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:14,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and one admiral's daughter.</font>

151
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:16,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Penny Benjamin?</font>

152
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:18,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you, asshole.</font>

153
00:14:19,113 --> 00:14:20,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're lucky to be here.</font>

154
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:21,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sir.</font>

155
00:14:22,283 --> 00:14:23,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And let's not bullshit, Maverick,</font>

156
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:25,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your family name ain't
the best in the Navy.</font>

157
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:28,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to be doing it better
and cleaner than the other guy.</font>

158
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:30,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, what is it with you?</font>

159
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:33,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just wanna serve my country,
be the best fighter pilot in the Navy, sir!</font>

160
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:35,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't screw around with me, Maverick.</font>

161
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:37,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a hell of an instinctive pilot.</font>

162
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe too good.</font>

163
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to bust your butt, but I can't.</font>

164
00:14:41,177 --> 00:14:42,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got another problem here.</font>

165
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:46,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta send somebody
from this squadron to Miramar.</font>

166
00:14:47,642 --> 00:14:48,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta do something here.</font>

167
00:14:48,726 --> 00:14:50,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still can't believe it.</font>

168
00:14:51,312 --> 00:14:52,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta give you your dream shot.</font>

169
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:54,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna send you up against the best.</font>

170
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:56,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two characters</font>

171
00:14:57,402 --> 00:14:58,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are going to Top gun.</font>

172
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:03,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For 5 weeks, you're gonna fly against
the best fighter pilots in the world.</font>

173
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were number 2,
Cougar was number 1.</font>

174
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:08,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar lost it, turned in his wings.</font>

175
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:10,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys are number 1.</font>

176
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you remember one thing.</font>

177
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:16,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You screw up just this much,</font>

178
00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:20,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'll be flying a cargo plane
full of rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong.</font>

179
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:22,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir!</font>

180
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:27,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is all.</font>

181
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:30,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can tell me about
the MIG some other time.</font>

182
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:31,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen.</font>

183
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck, gentlemen.</font>

184
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:35,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.</font>

185
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">During Korea,
the Navy kill ratio was 12-to-1.</font>

186
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:23,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We shot down 12 of their jets
for every one of ours.</font>

187
00:16:23,988 --> 00:16:26,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3-to-1.</font>

188
00:16:26,324 --> 00:16:28,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our pilots become dependent
upon missiles.</font>

189
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:30,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They had lost some
of their dogfighting skills.</font>

190
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:33,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now top gun was created
to teach A.C.M.</font>

191
00:16:33,498 --> 00:16:34,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Air combat maneuvering.</font>

192
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:36,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dogfighting.</font>

193
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:38,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This gives me a hard-on.</font>

194
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:41,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the end of Vietnam,
that ratio was back up to 12-to-1.</font>

195
00:16:41,672 --> 00:16:42,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't tease me.</font>

196
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:44,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blinds, please.</font>

197
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:45,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I'd like to take this opportunity</font>

198
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to introduce you to
our commanding officer at Top gun.</font>

199
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:50,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The very first man
to win the Top gun trophy.</font>

200
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:54,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will not find a finer fighter pilot
anywhere in the world.</font>

201
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:57,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Commander Mike Metcalf.
Callsign, Viper.</font>

202
00:16:58,272 --> 00:16:59,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen.</font>

203
00:17:00,608 --> 00:17:04,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are the top one percent
of all naval aviators.</font>

204
00:17:07,114 --> 00:17:08,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The elite.</font>

205
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:10,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The best of the best.</font>

206
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:12,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll make you better.</font>

207
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:15,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll fly at least
two combat missions a day,</font>

208
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">attend classes in between</font>

209
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:19,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and evaluations of your performance.</font>

210
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:21,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, on each combat sequence,</font>

211
00:17:21,546 --> 00:17:23,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're gonna meet a different challenge.</font>

212
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:26,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every encounter is gonna be
much more difficult.</font>

213
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:28,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna teach you to fly the F-14</font>

214
00:17:28,553 --> 00:17:29,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">right to the edge of the envelope,</font>

215
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">faster than you've ever flown before</font>

216
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:33,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and more dangerous.</font>

217
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:36,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, we don't make
policy here, gentlemen.</font>

218
00:17:37,895 --> 00:17:40,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elected officials, civilians do that.</font>

219
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:43,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are the instruments of that policy.</font>

220
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:48,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And although we're not at war, we must
always act as though we are at war.</font>

221
00:17:48,698 --> 00:17:49,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

222
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:51,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The tip of the spear...
- I'm just wondering...</font>

223
00:17:51,742 --> 00:17:52,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Best be sharp.</font>

224
00:17:52,868 --> 00:17:54,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's the best.</font>

225
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:56,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In case some of you wonder
who the best is,</font>

226
00:17:56,998 --> 00:17:59,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they're up here
on this plaque on the wall.</font>

227
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The best driver and his rio
from each class has his name on it.</font>

228
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:08,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they have the option to come
back here to be top gun instructors.</font>

229
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think your name's
gonna be on that plaque?</font>

230
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:16,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

231
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:19,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's pretty arrogant,
considering the company you're in.</font>

232
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:24,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

233
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:27,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like that in a pilot.</font>

234
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just remember, when it's over out there,
we're all on the same team.</font>

235
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen, this school
is about combat.</font>

236
00:18:38,873 --> 00:18:41,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are no points for second place.</font>

237
00:18:42,627 --> 00:18:43,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dismissed.</font>

238
00:18:43,794 --> 00:18:44,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice going.</font>

239
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:51,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The plaque for the alternates is
down in the ladies' room.</font>

240
00:18:55,097 --> 00:18:58,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Jesus. Oh, you kill me.
You really do.</font>

241
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:03,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no.
There's two o's in "Goose," boys.</font>

242
00:19:12,573 --> 00:19:13,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

243
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what I call
a target-rich environment.</font>

244
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:22,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You live your life
between your legs, Mav.</font>

245
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:25,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goose, even you could get laid
in a place like this.</font>

246
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm telling you, I'd be happy to
find a girl who'd talk dirty to me.</font>

247
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:35,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mav,</font>

248
00:19:35,262 --> 00:19:36,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you want to know who the best is?</font>

249
00:19:37,431 --> 00:19:38,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's him. Iceman.</font>

250
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:42,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the way he flies,
ice-cold, no mistakes.</font>

251
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:45,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just wears you down.
You get bored, frustrated,</font>

252
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do something stupid, and he's got you.</font>

253
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:50,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, Slider.</font>

254
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:53,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought you wanted to be a pilot, man.
What happened?</font>

255
00:19:53,864 --> 00:19:55,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goose, you're such a dickhead.</font>

256
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:56,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whose butt did you kiss to get in here?</font>

257
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:58,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the list is long but distinguished.</font>

258
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:00,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, so is my Johnson.</font>

259
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:03,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So you're flying with Iceman?
- It's Mr. Iceman to you.</font>

260
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, mother Goose. How's it going?
- Good, Tom.</font>

261
00:20:06,377 --> 00:20:09,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Pete Mitchell. Tom Kazansky.</font>

262
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:11,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Congratulations on Top gun.
- Thank you.</font>

263
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:13,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry to hear about Cougar.</font>

264
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:14,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He and I were like brothers
in flight school.</font>

265
00:20:15,177 --> 00:20:17,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He was a good man.
- Still is a good man.</font>

266
00:20:17,471 --> 00:20:18,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's what I meant.</font>

267
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:22,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thought so.
- Say, you need any help?</font>

268
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:25,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With what?</font>

269
00:20:25,563 --> 00:20:26,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You figured it out yet?</font>

270
00:20:28,315 --> 00:20:29,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

271
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:31,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's the best pilot.</font>

272
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I think I can figure
that one out on my own.</font>

273
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard that about you.</font>

274
00:20:37,074 --> 00:20:38,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like to work alone.</font>

275
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mav, you must've soloed
under a lucky star?</font>

276
00:20:43,664 --> 00:20:46,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, first the MIG, and then you guys
slide into Cougar's spot.</font>

277
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We didn't slide into Cougar's spot.
It was ours, okay?</font>

278
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:51,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, some pilots wait their
whole career just to see a MIG up close.</font>

279
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:54,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess you guys are lucky and famous?</font>

280
00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:55,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you mean notorious.</font>

281
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:57,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you later.</font>

282
00:20:58,596 --> 00:20:59,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can count on it.</font>

283
00:21:01,182 --> 00:21:02,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were abused children.</font>

284
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:06,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're gonna have a good time.
- Always.</font>

285
00:21:10,274 --> 00:21:13,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I guess it's my turn, isn't it?</font>

286
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, the bet is $20.</font>

287
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:16,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">$20. right.</font>

288
00:21:17,072 --> 00:21:18,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to have carnal knowledge,</font>

289
00:21:18,908 --> 00:21:20,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of a lady this time</font>

290
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:23,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- on the premises.
- On the premises.</font>

291
00:21:25,122 --> 00:21:27,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Mav. That's a bet.</font>

292
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:31,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, it just...
It just doesn't seem fair.</font>

293
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:32,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you, I mean.</font>

294
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:33,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But...</font>

295
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:36,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's lost that loving feeling.</font>

296
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:37,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's lost...</font>

297
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:38,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, she hasn't.
- Yes, she has.</font>

298
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:40,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She has not lost that...
- Goose, she's lost it.</font>

299
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:41,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mav. Come on.</font>

300
00:21:42,598 --> 00:21:45,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate it when she does that. Shit.</font>

301
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:52,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me, miss.
- Hey, hey, hey.</font>

302
00:21:52,817 --> 00:21:54,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, I'll take care of this.</font>

303
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never close your eyes anymore</font>

304
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I kiss your lips</font>

305
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:06,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's no tenderness like before</font>

306
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:10,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in your fingertips</font>

307
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:13,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're trying hard not to show it</font>

308
00:22:13,546 --> 00:22:15,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">baby</font>

309
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:17,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but, baby</font>

310
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">believe me I know it</font>

311
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you've lost that loving feeling</font>

312
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:30,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whoa, that loving feeling</font>

313
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:33,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you've lost that loving feeling</font>

314
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:37,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">now it's gone, gone, gone</font>

315
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:39,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whoa, whoa, whoa</font>

316
00:22:39,697 --> 00:22:44,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ba-doom, ba-doom
ba-doom boom boom ba-doom</font>

317
00:22:44,577 --> 00:22:45,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sit down.</font>

318
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:46,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ba-doom ba-doom boom boom
ba-doom, ba-doom...</font>

319
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:48,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

320
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:49,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby, baby</font>

321
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get down on my knees for you</font>

322
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ba-doom, ba-doom
ba-doom boom boom</font>

323
00:22:55,838 --> 00:22:57,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love that song.</font>

324
00:22:57,715 --> 00:22:59,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen that approach.</font>

325
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:00,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you would only love me...</font>

326
00:23:00,885 --> 00:23:02,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long have you two
been doing this act?</font>

327
00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:04,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I don't know, since...</font>

328
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:06,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Puberty?
- Right, puberty.</font>

329
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:10,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm Charlotte Blackwood.
- I'm Maverick.</font>

330
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:11,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick?</font>

331
00:23:12,438 --> 00:23:14,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did your mother not like you
or something?</font>

332
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:16,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's my callsign.</font>

333
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:19,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're a pilot.
- That's right, a naval aviator.</font>

334
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

335
00:23:21,405 --> 00:23:24,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, actually, we've only done this, twice.</font>

336
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:25,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, how'd you do?</font>

337
00:23:27,077 --> 00:23:29,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crashed and burnt on the first one.
It wasn't pretty.</font>

338
00:23:30,915 --> 00:23:32,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And second?
- I don't know. I'll tell you tomorrow.</font>

339
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's looking good so far.</font>

340
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, uh, Maverick,</font>

341
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:43,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my friend's just arrived,
so it's been great talking to you.</font>

342
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:45,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Perry.
- Hi.</font>

343
00:23:45,304 --> 00:23:46,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. Here you go.</font>

344
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:48,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'll be with you
in just a second, okay?</font>

345
00:23:51,143 --> 00:23:54,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, can I ask you
a personal question?</font>

346
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:56,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That depends.</font>

347
00:23:57,983 --> 00:24:00,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you a good pilot?</font>

348
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:03,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can hold my own.</font>

349
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:05,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great.</font>

350
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:09,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I won't have to worry about you
making your living as a singer.</font>

351
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:19,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna need a beer
to put these flames out. Yo!</font>

352
00:24:20,673 --> 00:24:22,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great, Mav. Real slick.</font>

353
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:50,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It was a long cruise, was it, sailor?
- It was too long.</font>

354
00:24:51,662 --> 00:24:54,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you wanna do, just drop
right down on the tile and go for it?</font>

355
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:57,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I actually had...</font>

356
00:24:57,918 --> 00:24:59,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Had this counter in mind.</font>

357
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:03,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great, that would be
very, very comfortable. Yeah.</font>

358
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:04,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It could be.</font>

359
00:25:07,386 --> 00:25:10,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I came in here
to save you from</font>

360
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:13,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">making a big mistake
with that older guy.</font>

361
00:25:14,351 --> 00:25:15,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

362
00:25:16,395 --> 00:25:20,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I could go on to a bigger one
with a young guy like yourself?</font>

363
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:23,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font>

364
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:25,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No?</font>

365
00:25:25,863 --> 00:25:27,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've gotta be at work
very early in the morning.</font>

366
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:29,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what are you doing here?</font>

367
00:25:31,201 --> 00:25:32,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your friend was magnificent.</font>

368
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:39,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah.</font>

369
00:25:42,212 --> 00:25:45,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you'll also be trained and
evaluated by a few civilian specialists.</font>

370
00:25:46,216 --> 00:25:48,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The civilians are here because
they are our very best source</font>

371
00:25:48,594 --> 00:25:50,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of information on enemy aircraft.</font>

372
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:53,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the most qualified
is our tagrep,</font>

373
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">callsign, Charlie.</font>

374
00:25:54,892 --> 00:25:57,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She has a P.H.D. In astrophysics,</font>

375
00:25:57,102 --> 00:25:58,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she's also a civilian contractor,</font>

376
00:25:58,896 --> 00:26:00,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you do not salute her.</font>

377
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:01,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you better listen to her,</font>

378
00:26:01,815 --> 00:26:04,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because the Pentagon listens to her
about your proficiency.</font>

379
00:26:04,443 --> 00:26:06,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's all yours, Charlie.
- Thank you.</font>

380
00:26:08,238 --> 00:26:09,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

381
00:26:09,406 --> 00:26:12,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will be dealing with F-5s and A-4s</font>

382
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as our MIG simulators.</font>

383
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:16,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, then, as most of you know,</font>

384
00:26:16,747 --> 00:26:19,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the F-5 doesn't have
the thrust-to-weight ratio</font>

385
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:20,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that the MIG-28 has.</font>

386
00:26:21,627 --> 00:26:23,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it doesn't bleed energy
below 300 knots,</font>

387
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:25,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like the MIG-28.</font>

388
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:26,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However,</font>

389
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:31,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the MIG-28 does have a problem
with its inverted flight tanks.</font>

390
00:26:31,595 --> 00:26:34,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It won't do a negative-G pushover.</font>

391
00:26:34,598 --> 00:26:36,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The latest intelligence...
- Are you gonna tell her?</font>

392
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tells us that the most it will do...
- Nothing.</font>

393
00:26:37,935 --> 00:26:39,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is one negative...</font>

394
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:42,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, lieutenant.</font>

395
00:26:43,107 --> 00:26:44,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there something wrong?</font>

396
00:26:44,525 --> 00:26:47,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am, the data
on the MIG is inaccurate.</font>

397
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's that, lieutenant?</font>

398
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:52,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I just happened to see
a MIG-28 do...</font>

399
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:54,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We, we.</font>

400
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:55,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Goose.</font>

401
00:26:55,786 --> 00:26:59,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We happened to see a MIG-28
do a 4-G negative dive.</font>

402
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:02,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did you see this?</font>

403
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:05,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's classified.</font>

404
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:06,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's what?</font>

405
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:08,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's classified.</font>

406
00:27:08,882 --> 00:27:10,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.</font>

407
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:13,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant, I have top secret clearance.</font>

408
00:27:13,846 --> 00:27:16,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Pentagon sees to it
that I know more than you.</font>

409
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:21,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, ma'am, it doesn't seem so
in this case, now, does it?</font>

410
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:23,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, lieutenant,</font>

411
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:26,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where exactly were you?</font>

412
00:27:27,818 --> 00:27:29,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, we...
- Thank you.</font>

413
00:27:29,673 --> 00:27:32,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Started up on a 6 when he pulled to the clouds</font>

414
00:27:32,656 --> 00:27:33,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then I moved in above him.</font>

415
00:27:33,824 --> 00:27:35,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if you were directly above him,</font>

416
00:27:35,826 --> 00:27:37,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how could you see him?</font>

417
00:27:38,162 --> 00:27:39,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I was inverted.</font>

418
00:27:39,496 --> 00:27:40,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bullshit.</font>

419
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:44,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he was, man.
It was a really great move.</font>

420
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:45,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was inverted.</font>

421
00:27:46,837 --> 00:27:48,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were in a 4-G</font>

422
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:51,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">inverted dive with a MIG-28?</font>

423
00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:54,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, ma'am.
- At what range?</font>

424
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:56,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. About 2 meters.</font>

425
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was actually about
one and a half, I think.</font>

426
00:27:58,682 --> 00:28:00,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was one and a half.
I've got a great polaroid of it.</font>

427
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's right there.
It must be one and a half.</font>

428
00:28:01,894 --> 00:28:02,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a nice picture.</font>

429
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant.</font>

430
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:05,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, I like my pictures.</font>

431
00:28:07,024 --> 00:28:08,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were you doing there?</font>

432
00:28:09,735 --> 00:28:11,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Communicating.
- Communicating.</font>

433
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:15,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keeping up foreign relations. I was,</font>

434
00:28:15,532 --> 00:28:17,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know, giving him the bird.</font>

435
00:28:18,952 --> 00:28:21,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know, the finger.
- Yes, I know the finger, Goose.</font>

436
00:28:21,872 --> 00:28:24,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, I hate it when it does that.
I'm sorry.</font>

437
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:26,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

438
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:29,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're the one.</font>

439
00:28:30,297 --> 00:28:31,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am.</font>

440
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:34,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, gentlemen,
we have a hop to take.</font>

441
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:37,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hard deck on this hop
will be 10,000 feet.</font>

442
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:39,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There'll be no engagement below that.</font>

443
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:41,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move it!</font>

444
00:28:43,268 --> 00:28:44,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Disappear like that.</font>

445
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant.</font>

446
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:51,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, well, don't be late again.</font>

447
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You look great, honey.
- Thanks, dear.</font>

448
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you in preflight.</font>

449
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:57,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant, why didn't you tell me</font>

450
00:28:57,157 --> 00:28:59,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you were a famous MIG insulter?</font>

451
00:28:59,576 --> 00:29:02,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Would it have made any difference?
- Not in the ladies' room, no.</font>

452
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:04,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what would've?</font>

453
00:29:05,332 --> 00:29:06,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm an instructor at this school.</font>

454
00:29:07,084 --> 00:29:09,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see 20 new hotshots
every 8 weeks.</font>

455
00:29:09,628 --> 00:29:11,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I'm sure you can figure that out.</font>

456
00:29:12,297 --> 00:29:13,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, lieutenant.</font>

457
00:29:14,675 --> 00:29:17,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd just really like to hear
about the MIG sometime.</font>

458
00:29:18,637 --> 00:29:20,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got security clearance.</font>

459
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:23,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can read about it.</font>

460
00:29:28,772 --> 00:29:29,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick.</font>

461
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:33,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm curious.</font>

462
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who was covering Cougar</font>

463
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:39,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while you were showboating
with this MIG?</font>

464
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:42,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cougar was doing just fine.</font>

465
00:29:45,122 --> 00:29:46,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen, this is your first hop.</font>

466
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The jets you are flying against</font>

467
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:50,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are smaller, faster
and more maneuverable,</font>

468
00:29:50,627 --> 00:29:51,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just like the enemy MIGs.</font>

469
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:54,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The clock is ticking,
and as of now, we are keeping score.</font>

470
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lost him, Goose.</font>

471
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:00,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show me what you got, kid.</font>

472
00:30:01,722 --> 00:30:04,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I lost him.
- I'm looking, I'm looking.</font>

473
00:30:06,643 --> 00:30:08,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got him, I got him.
He's on our tail, coming hard.</font>

474
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:11,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I got him. I got him. Here we go.</font>

475
00:30:24,077 --> 00:30:26,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right, talk to me, Goose.
- He's still back there.</font>

476
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's closing in on us. He's closing fast.</font>

477
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:31,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can run, kid, but you can't hide.</font>

478
00:30:35,672 --> 00:30:38,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Jester. Let's see if I can
give you a run for your money here.</font>

479
00:30:44,765 --> 00:30:46,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch the mountains.</font>

480
00:30:56,777 --> 00:30:58,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still got him. He's still back there.</font>

481
00:30:58,862 --> 00:31:00,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Mav.
Do some of that pilot shit.</font>

482
00:31:01,031 --> 00:31:02,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I got him.</font>

483
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:14,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, bring it right.</font>

484
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:17,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goose, I've had about enough
of this shit.</font>

485
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:21,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna hit the brakes,
he'll fly right by.</font>

486
00:31:21,093 --> 00:31:22,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you're mine.</font>

487
00:31:30,936 --> 00:31:32,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ.</font>

488
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:37,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see what you've got now, Jester.</font>

489
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Mav, let's turn and burn.</font>

490
00:31:57,921 --> 00:31:59,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going vertical, so am I.</font>

491
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:01,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going ballistic, Mav. Go get him.</font>

492
00:32:11,435 --> 00:32:12,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's going for the hard deck.</font>

493
00:32:12,602 --> 00:32:14,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get down there first
and nail him, Mav.</font>

494
00:32:14,771 --> 00:32:16,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way, Jester. You're mine.</font>

495
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you now.</font>

496
00:32:38,545 --> 00:32:39,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jester's dead.</font>

497
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jester's dead.</font>

498
00:32:45,469 --> 00:32:48,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your butts above the hard deck
and return to base immediately.</font>

499
00:32:52,184 --> 00:32:53,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

500
00:32:59,983 --> 00:33:02,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tower, this is Ghost Rider
requesting a flyby.</font>

501
00:33:03,862 --> 00:33:06,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Negative, Ghost Rider,
the pattern is full.</font>

502
00:33:06,323 --> 00:33:08,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, Mav. This is not a good idea.</font>

503
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:11,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Goose
but it's time to buzz the tower.</font>

504
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goddamn son of a bitch.</font>

505
00:33:30,722 --> 00:33:32,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great balls of fire!</font>

506
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jester's dead.</font>

507
00:33:36,853 --> 00:33:38,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won? That's bullshit.</font>

508
00:33:39,022 --> 00:33:41,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Didn't everybody?
- Hell, no, man, we got our butts kicked.</font>

509
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:45,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">30 seconds.
We went like this, he went like that.</font>

510
00:33:45,195 --> 00:33:46,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said to Hollywood, "where'd he go?"</font>

511
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hollywood just said, "where'd who go?"</font>

512
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, and he's laughing at us,
right on the radio. He's laughing at us.</font>

513
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:54,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's me laughing, dickhead.</font>

514
00:33:54,621 --> 00:33:55,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We won.</font>

515
00:33:55,747 --> 00:33:56,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right! All right!</font>

516
00:33:56,873 --> 00:33:57,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right.
- All right.</font>

517
00:33:58,083 --> 00:33:59,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They won too, man.</font>

518
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not what I heard.</font>

519
00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:03,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, we did, we got Jester.
- No, no.</font>

520
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:05,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Below the hard deck does not count.</font>

521
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:06,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hard deck, my ass.</font>

522
00:34:06,883 --> 00:34:08,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We nailed that son of a bitch.</font>

523
00:34:08,552 --> 00:34:09,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys really are cowboys.</font>

524
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:11,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your problem, Kazansky?</font>

525
00:34:13,765 --> 00:34:15,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're everyone's problem.</font>

526
00:34:15,892 --> 00:34:18,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's because every time
you go up in the air, you're unsafe.</font>

527
00:34:18,728 --> 00:34:20,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like you
because you're dangerous.</font>

528
00:34:20,397 --> 00:34:21,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

529
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iceman.</font>

530
00:34:25,068 --> 00:34:26,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am dangerous.</font>

531
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:30,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick.</font>

532
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:32,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and Goose get your butts
out of that flight gear</font>

533
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:34,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and up to Viper's office now.</font>

534
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:40,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember, boys,</font>

535
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:41,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no points for second place.</font>

536
00:34:43,086 --> 00:34:45,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're a lot brighter than you look.
- Oh, you shut up, okay?</font>

537
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't worry. Goose, don't worry.
- Okay, I will.</font>

538
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:50,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two of your snot-nosed jockeys
did a flyby on my tower</font>

539
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:51,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at over 400 knots!</font>

540
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want somebody's butt. I want it now.
I've had it.</font>

541
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh!
- God damn it!</font>

542
00:34:58,143 --> 00:34:59,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's twice.</font>

543
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:01,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want some butts!</font>

544
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:05,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that'll just about cover the flybys.</font>

545
00:35:06,693 --> 00:35:08,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>

546
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:13,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen.</font>

547
00:35:15,785 --> 00:35:18,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had a hell of a first day.</font>

548
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:24,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hard deck for this hop
was 10,000 feet.</font>

549
00:35:24,794 --> 00:35:26,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You knew it, you broke it.</font>

550
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:28,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You followed
Commander Heatherly below</font>

551
00:35:28,882 --> 00:35:31,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after he lost sight of you
and called no joy.</font>

552
00:35:33,553 --> 00:35:35,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why?
- Sir!</font>

553
00:35:36,348 --> 00:35:39,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had Commander Heatherly
in my sights.</font>

554
00:35:40,143 --> 00:35:41,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He saw me move in for the kill.</font>

555
00:35:41,561 --> 00:35:44,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He then proceeded
below the hard deck.</font>

556
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:47,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We weren't below 10,000
for more than a few seconds.</font>

557
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:49,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had the shot,</font>

558
00:35:49,736 --> 00:35:52,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there was no danger, so I took it.</font>

559
00:35:53,657 --> 00:35:54,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You took it.</font>

560
00:35:55,492 --> 00:35:57,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And broke a major rule of engagement.</font>

561
00:35:58,703 --> 00:35:59,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you broke another one</font>

562
00:35:59,996 --> 00:36:01,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with that circus-stunt flyby.</font>

563
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:06,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant Mitchell.</font>

564
00:36:06,503 --> 00:36:08,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Top gun rules of engagement
exist for your safety</font>

565
00:36:08,922 --> 00:36:10,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and for that of your team.</font>

566
00:36:10,507 --> 00:36:12,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are not flexible, nor am I.</font>

567
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Either obey them or you're history.
Is that clear?</font>

568
00:36:18,848 --> 00:36:19,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir!</font>

569
00:36:28,858 --> 00:36:29,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dismissed.</font>

570
00:36:35,615 --> 00:36:37,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really enjoyed that, Mav, thanks a lot.</font>

571
00:36:38,368 --> 00:36:39,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

572
00:36:44,582 --> 00:36:46,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I could learn how
to be a truck driver.</font>

573
00:36:46,876 --> 00:36:49,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mav, you have the number of that
truck-driving school we saw on TV?</font>

574
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:50,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truck master, I think it is.</font>

575
00:36:50,922 --> 00:36:52,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I MIGht need that.</font>

576
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:54,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His fitness report says it all.</font>

577
00:36:55,301 --> 00:36:56,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a wild card.</font>

578
00:36:57,303 --> 00:36:58,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flies by the seat of his pants.</font>

579
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Completely unpredictable.</font>

580
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:02,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He got you, didn't he?</font>

581
00:37:04,477 --> 00:37:05,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

582
00:37:05,979 --> 00:37:07,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick.</font>

583
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I flew with his old man.</font>

584
00:37:14,571 --> 00:37:15,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me one thing.</font>

585
00:37:16,823 --> 00:37:19,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you had to go into battle,
would you want him with you?</font>

586
00:37:19,242 --> 00:37:20,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

587
00:37:21,161 --> 00:37:22,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just don't know.</font>

588
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:38,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still awake? Yeah.</font>

589
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:42,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up?</font>

590
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't sleep.</font>

591
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, when I first realized
that we were going to Top gun,</font>

592
00:37:49,189 --> 00:37:51,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all I could think about
was getting that trophy.</font>

593
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta be straight with you, Mav.</font>

594
00:37:57,113 --> 00:37:59,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now, I just hope we graduate.</font>

595
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:02,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a family to think about.</font>

596
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:04,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't afford to blow this.</font>

597
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I guess that flyby wasn't
such a big hit, huh?</font>

598
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:18,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, man, I know it's tough for you.</font>

599
00:38:19,052 --> 00:38:20,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They wouldn't let you in the academy</font>

600
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:21,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because you're Duke Mitchell's kid and</font>

601
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:24,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you have to live with that reputation.</font>

602
00:38:25,225 --> 00:38:26,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's like every time we go up there,</font>

603
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:29,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's like you're flying against a ghost.</font>

604
00:38:31,147 --> 00:38:32,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It makes me nervous.</font>

605
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:39,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the only family I've got.</font>

606
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:42,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna let you down.
I promise you.</font>

607
00:38:52,836 --> 00:38:54,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of here.</font>

608
00:39:11,354 --> 00:39:14,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A rolling reversal would work well
in that situation.</font>

609
00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:19,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if I reversed on a hard cross,
I could immediately go to guns on them.</font>

610
00:39:19,863 --> 00:39:22,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but at that speed, it's too fast.</font>

611
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:25,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a little bit too aggressive.</font>

612
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:27,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too aggressive.</font>

613
00:39:30,206 --> 00:39:31,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I guess when I see something,</font>

614
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:32,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I go right after it.</font>

615
00:39:34,878 --> 00:39:36,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't tell me who you were
the other night.</font>

616
00:39:37,297 --> 00:39:39,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't give me a chance, did you?</font>

617
00:39:40,091 --> 00:39:41,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You deserved it.</font>

618
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

619
00:39:44,387 --> 00:39:45,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But</font>

620
00:39:46,055 --> 00:39:47,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you were tempted</font>

621
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to ask me out for dinner.</font>

622
00:39:51,394 --> 00:39:53,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- No?</font>

623
00:39:53,146 --> 00:39:54,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

624
00:39:54,564 --> 00:39:56,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't date students.</font>

625
00:40:05,825 --> 00:40:07,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see it's dangerous for you.</font>

626
00:40:08,411 --> 00:40:10,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if the government trusts me,</font>

627
00:40:11,915 --> 00:40:13,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe you could.</font>

628
00:40:20,757 --> 00:40:23,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.</font>

629
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crash and burn, huh, Mav?</font>

630
00:40:43,613 --> 00:40:44,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slider,</font>

631
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:49,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you stink.</font>

632
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:00,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

633
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Ice, yeah.</font>

634
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All set.</font>

635
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:08,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</font>

636
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:09,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back up, back up.</font>

637
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:14,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here it comes.</font>

638
00:41:15,186 --> 00:41:16,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's good.</font>

639
00:41:16,354 --> 00:41:17,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

640
00:41:18,648 --> 00:41:19,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, now.</font>

641
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:32,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Mav, let's get them.</font>

642
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those guys are animals.</font>

643
00:41:38,835 --> 00:41:39,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>

644
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

645
00:41:42,338 --> 00:41:43,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oh, good serve, good serve.</font>

646
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:51,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right!</font>

647
00:41:52,432 --> 00:41:53,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

648
00:41:55,018 --> 00:41:56,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

649
00:42:07,864 --> 00:42:09,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's game.</font>

650
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Fake block.
Stay down. We'll just take them.</font>

651
00:42:13,578 --> 00:42:14,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

652
00:42:17,206 --> 00:42:19,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, where you guys going?
You walking away?</font>

653
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:21,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We won, we won. Come on!</font>

654
00:42:21,419 --> 00:42:23,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mav. Mav. Come on, man.</font>

655
00:42:23,546 --> 00:42:24,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just one more game. That evens it up.</font>

656
00:42:24,881 --> 00:42:26,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, we can take them.
- No.</font>

657
00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:27,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we can, we got it.</font>

658
00:42:27,633 --> 00:42:29,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got some things I gotta take care of.</font>

659
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take care of? Just one more game.</font>

660
00:42:31,721 --> 00:42:33,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please? For me?</font>

661
00:42:33,139 --> 00:42:34,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.</font>

662
00:42:34,265 --> 00:42:35,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on.
- Come on!</font>

663
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mother Goose, you pussy!
- For me?</font>

664
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:11,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it.</font>

665
00:43:23,606 --> 00:43:24,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant?</font>

666
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:32,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah...
- What, no singing?</font>

667
00:43:34,117 --> 00:43:37,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look, I'm... I'm...
- No apologies.</font>

668
00:43:45,962 --> 00:43:46,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't mind, I'm...</font>

669
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna just take a quick shower</font>

670
00:43:48,381 --> 00:43:50,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while you're finishing up here.</font>

671
00:43:52,718 --> 00:43:54,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I do mind.</font>

672
00:43:55,805 --> 00:43:57,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm hungry.</font>

673
00:44:00,643 --> 00:44:01,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then</font>

674
00:44:02,478 --> 00:44:03,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought about it.</font>

675
00:44:04,647 --> 00:44:05,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought,</font>

676
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"you know, Charlie, he's a smart guy.</font>

677
00:44:10,403 --> 00:44:12,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Why don't you just tell him
why you've got him here."</font>

678
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:15,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well?</font>

679
00:44:16,993 --> 00:44:18,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the MIG.</font>

680
00:44:22,665 --> 00:44:23,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The MIG.</font>

681
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:27,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the only pilot
who's been up against a MIG-28.</font>

682
00:44:31,007 --> 00:44:32,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying for this big promotion at work,</font>

683
00:44:32,758 --> 00:44:34,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and if I get it,
I'm not gonna be here much longer.</font>

684
00:44:36,596 --> 00:44:39,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It seems to me you've got it
all figured out.</font>

685
00:44:39,432 --> 00:44:40,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

686
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:44,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except you did forget the wine.</font>

687
00:44:45,521 --> 00:44:46,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

688
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

689
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:52,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You always get what you want?</font>

690
00:44:52,195 --> 00:44:53,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not always.</font>

691
00:44:54,697 --> 00:44:56,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, maybe.</font>

692
00:44:56,282 --> 00:44:58,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then relax about the MIG.</font>

693
00:45:13,716 --> 00:45:14,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This music.</font>

694
00:45:17,637 --> 00:45:19,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An old friend?</font>

695
00:45:21,224 --> 00:45:22,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My folks loved it.</font>

696
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:25,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't heard this in years.</font>

697
00:45:27,396 --> 00:45:29,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mother used to
call down from her room</font>

698
00:45:29,899 --> 00:45:32,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and have me play this
over and over again.</font>

699
00:45:32,735 --> 00:45:34,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got so sick of it.</font>

700
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But not her, she...</font>

701
00:45:39,784 --> 00:45:42,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just sit up there alone,
just listening, hours.</font>

702
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:45,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just listening.</font>

703
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She died shortly after him.</font>

704
00:45:51,587 --> 00:45:52,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to your father?</font>

705
00:45:58,928 --> 00:46:02,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I kind of figured,
with your security clearance,</font>

706
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:04,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'd know more about him than I do.</font>

707
00:46:06,435 --> 00:46:08,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, I didn't get that far.
- Oh.</font>

708
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's a big mystery.</font>

709
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:19,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He disappeared in an F-4,
November 5th, 1965.</font>

710
00:46:22,285 --> 00:46:23,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The stink of it was,</font>

711
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he screwed up.</font>

712
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:28,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way.</font>

713
00:46:29,959 --> 00:46:31,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My old man was a great fighter pilot.</font>

714
00:46:36,007 --> 00:46:39,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But who the hell knows?
It's all classified.</font>

715
00:46:42,346 --> 00:46:43,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody must know.</font>

716
00:46:44,473 --> 00:46:46,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, somebody knows everything.</font>

717
00:46:47,351 --> 00:46:49,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that why you're always
second best up there?</font>

718
00:46:52,023 --> 00:46:53,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are direct, aren't you?</font>

719
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:04,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry I was late.</font>

720
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:08,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry for being direct.</font>

721
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No apologies.</font>

722
00:47:13,878 --> 00:47:15,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is gonna be complicated.</font>

723
00:47:28,184 --> 00:47:29,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going?</font>

724
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:32,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna take a shower.</font>

725
00:47:37,026 --> 00:47:38,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

726
00:47:39,028 --> 00:47:40,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I enjoyed being here.</font>

727
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:21,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks like you need another shower.</font>

728
00:48:23,948 --> 00:48:24,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

729
00:48:31,664 --> 00:48:33,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna be honest with you.</font>

730
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:38,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your MIG sighting is really
important to my work, but...</font>

731
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't normally invite
students to my house.</font>

732
00:48:48,347 --> 00:48:49,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're...</font>

733
00:48:57,773 --> 00:49:00,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But... please understand,
I still have a job to do.</font>

734
00:49:02,987 --> 00:49:04,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Morning.
- Sir.</font>

735
00:49:04,113 --> 00:49:05,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morning.</font>

736
00:49:27,511 --> 00:49:29,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad we got that straight.</font>

737
00:49:48,449 --> 00:49:50,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told her how tough it is here.</font>

738
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:53,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, my ass dragging
like an old, tired dog.</font>

739
00:49:53,662 --> 00:49:55,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told her that you didn't
even have a woman here.</font>

740
00:49:55,664 --> 00:49:56,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, really.</font>

741
00:49:56,832 --> 00:49:57,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what she said?</font>

742
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Said, "oh, he probably
doesn't have one,</font>

743
00:49:59,668 --> 00:50:00,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"he's got 8."</font>

744
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi! Daddy!</font>

745
00:50:16,977 --> 00:50:18,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Maverick,</font>

746
00:50:18,479 --> 00:50:21,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goose tells me you're in love
with one of your instructors.</font>

747
00:50:21,857 --> 00:50:24,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that right?
- I didn't tell her that.</font>

748
00:50:24,527 --> 00:50:25,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you did. I...</font>

749
00:50:26,195 --> 00:50:27,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, you did.
- I can't believe you said that.</font>

750
00:50:27,738 --> 00:50:29,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That was a secret.
- No.</font>

751
00:50:35,829 --> 00:50:37,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bogey has good position right here.</font>

752
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, freeze-frame.</font>

753
00:50:40,084 --> 00:50:41,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Moment of choice.</font>

754
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The F-14 is defensive.</font>

755
00:50:43,837 --> 00:50:45,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has a chance to bug out right here.</font>

756
00:50:46,215 --> 00:50:49,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better to retire and save your aircraft</font>

757
00:50:50,261 --> 00:50:52,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than push a bad position.</font>

758
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:54,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charlie, jump in here anytime.</font>

759
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:57,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you stay in that diamond
another 3 seconds,</font>

760
00:50:57,768 --> 00:51:00,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the bogey's gonna blow you
out of the sky.</font>

761
00:51:00,354 --> 00:51:03,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You take a hard right, select zone 5,</font>

762
00:51:03,399 --> 00:51:05,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you can extend an escape.</font>

763
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You made a bad choice.</font>

764
00:51:09,613 --> 00:51:10,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charlie.</font>

765
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aircraft one performs a split S?</font>

766
00:51:16,412 --> 00:51:18,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the last thing you should do.</font>

767
00:51:18,581 --> 00:51:20,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The MIG's right on your tail.</font>

768
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:21,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freeze there, please.</font>

769
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:26,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The MIG has you in his gunsight.
What were you thinking at this point?</font>

770
00:51:26,922 --> 00:51:29,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have time to think up there.</font>

771
00:51:29,091 --> 00:51:30,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you think,</font>

772
00:51:30,593 --> 00:51:31,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're dead.</font>

773
00:51:31,927 --> 00:51:33,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's a big gamble</font>

774
00:51:33,137 --> 00:51:35,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a $30 million plane, lieutenant.</font>

775
00:51:42,896 --> 00:51:44,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately, the gamble worked.</font>

776
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The MIG never got a clean shot.</font>

777
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:50,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick makes
an aggressive vertical move here,</font>

778
00:51:50,904 --> 00:51:54,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">comes over the top, and he defeats
the bandit with a missile shot.</font>

779
00:51:55,117 --> 00:51:56,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The encounter was a victory,</font>

780
00:51:56,952 --> 00:52:01,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I think that we've shown it
as an example of what not to do.</font>

781
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:03,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next.</font>

782
00:52:04,918 --> 00:52:06,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.</font>

783
00:52:10,924 --> 00:52:15,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, then, this is a perfect example
of a textbook maneuver.</font>

784
00:52:28,317 --> 00:52:29,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant.</font>

785
00:52:34,114 --> 00:52:35,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick.</font>

786
00:52:38,035 --> 00:52:39,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant.</font>

787
00:52:40,663 --> 00:52:42,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant.</font>

788
00:52:42,956 --> 00:52:45,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My review of your flight performance
in the tacts</font>

789
00:52:45,334 --> 00:52:47,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was right on,
in my professional opinion.</font>

790
00:52:48,128 --> 00:52:49,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't hear you.</font>

791
00:53:10,484 --> 00:53:11,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ!</font>

792
00:53:12,027 --> 00:53:13,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you think I'm reckless!</font>

793
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I fly, I'll have you know</font>

794
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:16,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that my crew and my plane come first!</font>

795
00:53:17,032 --> 00:53:19,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm going to finish
my sentence, lieutenant.</font>

796
00:53:19,535 --> 00:53:22,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My review of your flight
performance was right on.</font>

797
00:53:22,162 --> 00:53:23,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that right?
- That is right.</font>

798
00:53:24,206 --> 00:53:25,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I held something back.</font>

799
00:53:25,999 --> 00:53:27,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see some real genius
in your flying, Maverick,</font>

800
00:53:28,043 --> 00:53:29,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I can't say that in there.</font>

801
00:53:29,712 --> 00:53:31,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was afraid that everyone
in that tacts trailer</font>

802
00:53:31,714 --> 00:53:33,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would see right through me.</font>

803
00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:36,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I just don't want anyone to know
that I've fallen for you.</font>

804
00:55:23,158 --> 00:55:24,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Maverick. Yeah.</font>

805
00:55:24,701 --> 00:55:25,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hear about Ice?</font>

806
00:55:26,954 --> 00:55:28,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's that?
- He won another one.</font>

807
00:55:29,665 --> 00:55:31,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? Yeah.</font>

808
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:33,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel the need,</font>

809
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:36,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- the need for speed.
- The need for speed.</font>

810
00:55:41,051 --> 00:55:43,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen, this is hop 19.</font>

811
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Multiple aircraft, multiple bogies.</font>

812
00:55:45,556 --> 00:55:47,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your training is half over.</font>

813
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:50,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The competition for the top gun trophy
remains tight.</font>

814
00:55:50,143 --> 00:55:51,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First place, iceman.</font>

815
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Second place, Maverick,
just 2 points behind.</font>

816
00:55:55,858 --> 00:55:58,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There they are.
3 miles, left, 10 o'clock.</font>

817
00:55:58,402 --> 00:55:59,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think they see us yet.</font>

818
00:55:59,528 --> 00:56:00,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I see them.</font>

819
00:56:00,863 --> 00:56:03,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 A-4s, left 10 o'clock level,
continue left turn.</font>

820
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:15,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning, gentlemen.
The temperature's 110 degrees.</font>

821
00:56:15,711 --> 00:56:17,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit, it's Viper.</font>

822
00:56:17,713 --> 00:56:19,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Viper's up here, great.</font>

823
00:56:19,882 --> 00:56:21,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

824
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:24,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great. He's probably saying,
"holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose."</font>

825
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:26,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm sure he's saying that.</font>

826
00:56:30,183 --> 00:56:31,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got my eye on the northern bogey.</font>

827
00:56:31,935 --> 00:56:33,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roger. I got the Southern guy.</font>

828
00:56:36,064 --> 00:56:38,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hollywood, you've got the lead,
I'll cover you.</font>

829
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:52,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Break now, Jester.</font>

830
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hollywood, we're losing Viper.
Let's just stay on Jester.</font>

831
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:00,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roger, I'm on him.</font>

832
00:57:04,885 --> 00:57:07,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goose, find Viper.
He's out there somewhere.</font>

833
00:57:07,888 --> 00:57:10,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with Hollywood, Mav,
we're covering his wing.</font>

834
00:57:12,434 --> 00:57:14,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goose, there's Viper. 3 o'clock, low.</font>

835
00:57:15,103 --> 00:57:17,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with Hollywood, Mav.
We're his cover.</font>

836
00:57:17,397 --> 00:57:19,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you leave me, Maverick.</font>

837
00:57:19,441 --> 00:57:21,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hollywood, you're looking good.</font>

838
00:57:21,777 --> 00:57:23,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going after Viper.</font>

839
00:57:26,323 --> 00:57:27,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn you, Maverick.</font>

840
00:57:28,075 --> 00:57:29,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mav, don't leave him.</font>

841
00:57:29,451 --> 00:57:32,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goose, Hollywood's okay. I want Viper.</font>

842
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:38,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand by. Viper's coming down.</font>

843
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit, we're head-to-head.
I can't believe we're doing this.</font>

844
00:58:03,318 --> 00:58:04,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rock 'n' roll.</font>

845
00:58:04,444 --> 00:58:06,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's our chance.
It's a big one, Goose.</font>

846
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:10,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, god damn it.</font>

847
00:58:13,996 --> 00:58:15,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Mav, keep coming.</font>

848
00:58:19,793 --> 00:58:21,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Sidewinder missile selected.</font>

849
00:58:21,837 --> 00:58:23,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, baby. Come on, baby.</font>

850
00:58:23,964 --> 00:58:26,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come around, come around.
That's it, that's it.</font>

851
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:33,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus, this guy's good.</font>

852
00:58:34,224 --> 00:58:36,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goose, where's he going?</font>

853
00:58:36,143 --> 00:58:37,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on, come on,
keep coming.</font>

854
00:58:37,894 --> 00:58:39,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep coming!</font>

855
00:58:43,025 --> 00:58:44,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, baby.</font>

856
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:51,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn, this kid's good.</font>

857
00:58:53,035 --> 00:58:55,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's too close for missiles, Goose,
I'm switching to guns.</font>

858
00:58:58,749 --> 00:59:00,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on, come on.</font>

859
00:59:03,211 --> 00:59:05,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stick with me, stick with me.</font>

860
00:59:09,051 --> 00:59:11,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What... hold it. Goose, check our tail.</font>

861
00:59:11,511 --> 00:59:13,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. There's Jester.</font>

862
00:59:13,513 --> 00:59:15,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bingo, Maverick's dead.
You're out of there, kid.</font>

863
00:59:16,016 --> 00:59:17,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

864
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The defense department
regrets to inform you</font>

865
00:59:20,187 --> 00:59:22,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that your sons are dead
because they were stupid.</font>

866
00:59:23,565 --> 00:59:25,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great balls of fire.</font>

867
00:59:26,234 --> 00:59:27,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, knock it off, gentlemen.</font>

868
00:59:27,903 --> 00:59:29,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go home. Viper has the lead.</font>

869
00:59:35,368 --> 00:59:37,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">30 seconds, Wolfman,
and I'm coming in.</font>

870
00:59:38,288 --> 00:59:39,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up!</font>

871
00:59:39,456 --> 00:59:40,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, buttnose!</font>

872
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:43,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was some of the best
flying I've seen yet,</font>

873
00:59:44,086 --> 00:59:46,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">right up to the part where you got killed.</font>

874
00:59:46,588 --> 00:59:48,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never, never leave your wingman.</font>

875
00:59:56,431 --> 00:59:57,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick,</font>

876
00:59:59,601 --> 01:00:01,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's not your flying,</font>

877
01:00:01,394 --> 01:00:02,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's your attitude.</font>

878
01:00:03,605 --> 01:00:05,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The enemy's dangerous,</font>

879
01:00:05,941 --> 01:00:08,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but right now
you're worse than the enemy.</font>

880
01:00:08,985 --> 01:00:11,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're dangerous and foolish.</font>

881
01:00:11,613 --> 01:00:14,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may not like the guys
flying with you, they may not like you,</font>

882
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:17,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but whose side are you on?</font>

883
01:00:25,919 --> 01:00:28,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, at least Viper got Iceman
before he got us.</font>

884
01:00:29,965 --> 01:00:31,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We still got a shot at it.</font>

885
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:35,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was stupid. I know better than that.</font>

886
01:00:36,471 --> 01:00:38,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll never happen again.</font>

887
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:43,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

888
01:00:48,441 --> 01:00:49,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

889
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:30,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shake my nerves
and you rattle my brain</font>

890
01:01:31,568 --> 01:01:33,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thinking about your love
drives a man insane</font>

891
01:01:34,321 --> 01:01:35,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you break my will</font>

892
01:01:35,447 --> 01:01:36,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oh, what a thrill</font>

893
01:01:37,032 --> 01:01:39,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">goodness gracious, great balls of fire</font>

894
01:01:40,702 --> 01:01:42,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick, would you go fetch him?</font>

895
01:01:43,038 --> 01:01:46,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Doesn't he ever embarrass you?
- Goose? Hell, no.</font>

896
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:48,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, there was the time...
- Admiral's daughter.</font>

897
01:01:48,835 --> 01:01:51,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Come on.</font>

898
01:01:52,047 --> 01:01:55,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He told me all about the time
you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin.</font>

899
01:01:56,551 --> 01:01:58,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he? Well, that's great.</font>

900
01:01:58,845 --> 01:02:00,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He tells me about all of them, Maverick.</font>

901
01:02:01,223 --> 01:02:04,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How my little angel, Goose,
goes home early for church,</font>

902
01:02:04,851 --> 01:02:08,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you, you always go home
with the hot women.</font>

903
01:02:08,146 --> 01:02:09,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, thank you, Carole.</font>

904
01:02:09,648 --> 01:02:12,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna go embarrass myself
with Goose for a while.</font>

905
01:02:15,403 --> 01:02:16,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dancing!</font>

906
01:02:18,573 --> 01:02:21,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shake my nerves
and you rattle my brain</font>

907
01:02:21,576 --> 01:02:24,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thinking "bout your love
drives a man insane</font>

908
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:27,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you broke my will, oh, what a thrill</font>

909
01:02:27,415 --> 01:02:30,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">goodness gracious, great balls of fire</font>

910
01:02:31,169 --> 01:02:33,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would love to be able
to warn you off about Maverick,</font>

911
01:02:33,421 --> 01:02:35,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I just love him to death.</font>

912
01:02:37,425 --> 01:02:40,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I've known Pete
for a lot of years now, and...</font>

913
01:02:40,512 --> 01:02:42,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm telling you, one thing's for certain.</font>

914
01:02:42,681 --> 01:02:45,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are hearts breaking wide open</font>

915
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all over the world tonight.</font>

916
01:02:47,269 --> 01:02:48,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

917
01:02:48,436 --> 01:02:50,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because unless you are a fool,</font>

918
01:02:51,106 --> 01:02:52,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that boy is off the market.</font>

919
01:02:53,108 --> 01:02:54,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is 100 percent,</font>

920
01:02:54,609 --> 01:02:57,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">prime-time in love with you.</font>

921
01:02:58,571 --> 01:03:00,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Goose, you big stud!</font>

922
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:02,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's me, honey.</font>

923
01:03:02,284 --> 01:03:04,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take me to bed or lose me forever.</font>

924
01:03:04,536 --> 01:03:06,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show me the way home, honey.</font>

925
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:10,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, brother, sing with the family.</font>

926
01:03:13,962 --> 01:03:16,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shake my nerves
and you rattle my brain</font>

927
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:19,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thinking about your love
drives a man insane</font>

928
01:03:19,968 --> 01:03:22,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you broke my will, oh, what a thrill</font>

929
01:03:22,804 --> 01:03:26,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">goodness gracious, great balls of fire</font>

930
01:03:42,991 --> 01:03:44,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick,</font>

931
01:03:46,161 --> 01:03:47,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you big stud,</font>

932
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:50,657

933
01:04:04,346 --> 01:04:06,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, gentlemen, this is hop 31.</font>

934
01:04:06,473 --> 01:04:08,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 weeks to graduation.</font>

935
01:04:08,433 --> 01:04:11,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Top gun trophy is still up for grabs,
so every point counts.</font>

936
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:57,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's bottom of the ninth,
the score is tied.</font>

937
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:58,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time for the big one.</font>

938
01:04:58,817 --> 01:05:00,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You up for this one, Maverick?</font>

939
01:05:00,402 --> 01:05:02,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a walk in the park, Kazansky.</font>

940
01:05:06,741 --> 01:05:09,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Contact. Multiple bogies, 165.</font>

941
01:05:09,702 --> 01:05:11,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 miles.
Looks like they're going away from us.</font>

942
01:05:11,996 --> 01:05:14,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ho, I see them, tallyho, right 2 o'clock.
I'm in.</font>

943
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:16,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm in.</font>

944
01:05:36,104 --> 01:05:38,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That son of a bitch cut me off.</font>

945
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on. Jesus Christ.</font>

946
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:50,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ice, take the shot.</font>

947
01:05:50,452 --> 01:05:52,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Ice, get the hell out of there.</font>

948
01:05:52,537 --> 01:05:54,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't get the angle.
I'm too close for missiles.</font>

949
01:05:54,414 --> 01:05:55,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm switching to guns.</font>

950
01:05:56,499 --> 01:05:58,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ice, fire or clear.</font>

951
01:06:05,049 --> 01:06:08,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this! Jesus Christ,
I can take a shot right here!</font>

952
01:06:08,386 --> 01:06:10,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need another 20 seconds,
then I've got it.</font>

953
01:06:16,144 --> 01:06:17,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm moving in. I've got the shot.</font>

954
01:06:17,896 --> 01:06:20,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Mav, let's get in there!
Come on, Mav!</font>

955
01:06:21,941 --> 01:06:24,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick's getting impatient, Ice.
Come on, take the shot.</font>

956
01:06:24,277 --> 01:06:25,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10 more seconds, then I've got him.</font>

957
01:06:27,655 --> 01:06:30,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Ice, get the hell out of there!
Let's do it, Mav.</font>

958
01:06:30,909 --> 01:06:32,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ice, come off high right. I'm in.</font>

959
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:35,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 5 more seconds.
- Come off high right, Ice. I'm in.</font>

960
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:37,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm off. Shit!</font>

961
01:06:40,585 --> 01:06:41,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're in his jet wash!</font>

962
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ho! Holy shit!</font>

963
01:06:46,633 --> 01:06:49,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not good.
Shit, we got a flameout, Mav.</font>

964
01:06:49,302 --> 01:06:50,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Engine 1 is out.</font>

965
01:06:51,012 --> 01:06:52,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Engine 2 is out!</font>

966
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:54,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goose, I'm losing control.
I'm losing control.</font>

967
01:06:54,098 --> 01:06:57,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't control it. It won't recover. Shit.</font>

968
01:06:59,812 --> 01:07:01,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's coupling up, Mav!
We're out of control.</font>

969
01:07:01,689 --> 01:07:03,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not good! This is not good!</font>

970
01:07:03,775 --> 01:07:05,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mayday, mayday. Mav's in trouble.</font>

971
01:07:05,485 --> 01:07:07,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's in a flat spin.
He's heading out to sea.</font>

972
01:07:10,823 --> 01:07:13,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Altitude 8,000, 7,000.</font>

973
01:07:14,869 --> 01:07:17,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6. We're at 6, Mav.</font>

974
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:22,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm pinned forward, Goose.
I can't reach the ejection handle.</font>

975
01:07:24,837 --> 01:07:26,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goose, you're gonna
have to punch us out.</font>

976
01:07:27,006 --> 01:07:28,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't reach the ejection handle.</font>

977
01:07:28,716 --> 01:07:30,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Eject.
- I'm trying! I'm trying!</font>

978
01:07:30,843 --> 01:07:32,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eject! Eject! Eject!</font>

979
01:07:32,512 --> 01:07:34,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch the canopy!</font>

980
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:54,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goose! Goose! Oh, no!</font>

981
01:07:55,159 --> 01:07:56,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

982
01:07:57,579 --> 01:08:00,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oh, god! Oh, god! Oh, god.</font>

983
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:02,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

984
01:08:14,846 --> 01:08:16,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, god.</font>

985
01:08:47,629 --> 01:08:49,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, let go of him.</font>

986
01:08:49,631 --> 01:08:51,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta let him go, sir.</font>

987
01:09:34,842 --> 01:09:36,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How you doing?</font>

988
01:09:36,803 --> 01:09:37,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm all right.</font>

989
01:09:40,807 --> 01:09:43,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Goose is dead.
- I know.</font>

990
01:09:47,855 --> 01:09:51,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fly jets long enough,
something like this happens.</font>

991
01:09:52,777 --> 01:09:55,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was my rio, my responsibility.</font>

992
01:09:58,991 --> 01:10:02,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In my squadron in Vietnam,
we lost 8 of 18 aircraft.</font>

993
01:10:02,161 --> 01:10:03,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10 men.</font>

994
01:10:05,123 --> 01:10:06,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First one dies, you die too.</font>

995
01:10:08,334 --> 01:10:09,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there will be others.</font>

996
01:10:11,671 --> 01:10:13,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can count on it.</font>

997
01:10:15,383 --> 01:10:16,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta let him go.</font>

998
01:10:20,555 --> 01:10:22,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta let him go.</font>

999
01:10:40,324 --> 01:10:42,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think maybe it was my fault.</font>

1000
01:10:44,412 --> 01:10:46,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah.</font>

1001
01:10:47,999 --> 01:10:50,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what the hell went wrong.</font>

1002
01:10:53,379 --> 01:10:54,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to help.</font>

1003
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:57,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it's difficult.</font>

1004
01:11:03,055 --> 01:11:04,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I want him back.</font>

1005
01:11:11,731 --> 01:11:14,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be here if you need me, okay?</font>

1006
01:13:07,388 --> 01:13:09,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.</font>

1007
01:13:28,242 --> 01:13:30,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he'd have flown anyway</font>

1008
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:32,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without you.</font>

1009
01:13:34,373 --> 01:13:37,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'd have hated it,
but he would've done it.</font>

1010
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:03,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We find that the F-14 flat spin
was induced by the disruption of airflow</font>

1011
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:05,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into the starboard engine.</font>

1012
01:14:06,072 --> 01:14:09,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This disruption stalled the engine,</font>

1013
01:14:09,784 --> 01:14:12,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which produced enough yaw rate</font>

1014
01:14:12,787 --> 01:14:17,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to induce a spin
which was unrecoverable.</font>

1015
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:21,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was no way lieutenant Mitchell
could either see or avoid the jet wash</font>

1016
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:23,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which produced the engine stall.</font>

1017
01:14:23,714 --> 01:14:25,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Therefore, the board of inquiry finds</font>

1018
01:14:25,383 --> 01:14:27,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that lieutenant Pete Mitchell
was not at fault</font>

1019
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:29,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the accident of 29 July.</font>

1020
01:14:29,428 --> 01:14:31,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant Mitchell's record
will be cleared of this incident.</font>

1021
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:35,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lieutenant Mitchell is restored
to flight status without further delay.</font>

1022
01:14:36,936 --> 01:14:38,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These proceedings are closed.</font>

1023
01:14:47,905 --> 01:14:49,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him up flying, soon.</font>

1024
01:15:16,934 --> 01:15:19,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, kid, come on.
Get in there. Engage.</font>

1025
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:21,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, you got a bogey
at 2 o'clock low, Maverick.</font>

1026
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:23,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got the angle. Piece of cake, pal.</font>

1027
01:15:27,194 --> 01:15:29,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take the shot, kid. Take the shot.</font>

1028
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:32,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can engage any time, Maverick.</font>

1029
01:15:44,128 --> 01:15:46,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, where the hell are you going?
- It's not good.</font>

1030
01:15:46,505 --> 01:15:48,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It... it doesn't look good.</font>

1031
01:15:48,132 --> 01:15:49,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean,
it doesn't look good?</font>

1032
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:51,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't get to look
any better than that.</font>

1033
01:16:04,023 --> 01:16:05,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, man, we could've had him.</font>

1034
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, we could've had him, man!</font>

1035
01:16:10,071 --> 01:16:12,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will fire
when I am goddamn good and ready!</font>

1036
01:16:13,532 --> 01:16:14,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got that?</font>

1037
01:16:33,427 --> 01:16:35,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He can't get back in the saddle.
Won't engage.</font>

1038
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:38,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's only been a few days.</font>

1039
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, he just might
not make it back.</font>

1040
01:16:45,064 --> 01:16:46,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep sending him up.</font>

1041
01:17:06,043 --> 01:17:07,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mitchell.</font>

1042
01:17:08,796 --> 01:17:10,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry about Goose.</font>

1043
01:17:14,635 --> 01:17:16,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody liked him.</font>

1044
01:17:22,268 --> 01:17:23,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1045
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:45,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, it's Wolfman.</font>

1046
01:17:48,127 --> 01:17:50,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Maverick just quit.</font>

1047
01:18:12,651 --> 01:18:13,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

1048
01:18:17,948 --> 01:18:18,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I?</font>

1049
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:20,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

1050
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:32,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll have what he's having.</font>

1051
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:33,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hemlock, is it?</font>

1052
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:36,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ice water.</font>

1053
01:18:41,222 --> 01:18:43,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You weren't gonna say goodbye?</font>

1054
01:18:45,226 --> 01:18:48,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard you got that job in Washington.</font>

1055
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:51,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Congratulations.
- Thanks.</font>

1056
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:57,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I wasn't gonna leave
without saying goodbye.</font>

1057
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:58,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

1058
01:19:01,242 --> 01:19:03,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good to see you.</font>

1059
01:19:03,869 --> 01:19:05,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

1060
01:19:07,289 --> 01:19:08,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where you going?</font>

1061
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:12,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't even have a ticket, do you?</font>

1062
01:19:13,629 --> 01:19:17,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I've seen all the evidence,
and it's not your responsibility.</font>

1063
01:19:18,592 --> 01:19:20,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not your fault.</font>

1064
01:19:22,054 --> 01:19:24,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're one of the best pilots
in the Navy.</font>

1065
01:19:25,808 --> 01:19:29,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you do up there, it's dangerous.</font>

1066
01:19:30,646 --> 01:19:32,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you've got to go on.</font>

1067
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:35,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you don't understand.</font>

1068
01:19:36,735 --> 01:19:38,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I first met you,</font>

1069
01:19:39,697 --> 01:19:41,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you were larger than life.</font>

1070
01:19:43,993 --> 01:19:45,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at you.</font>

1071
01:19:47,496 --> 01:19:50,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not gonna be happy
unless you're going mach 2</font>

1072
01:19:50,457 --> 01:19:52,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with your hair on fire, you know that.</font>

1073
01:19:52,543 --> 01:19:54,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's over.</font>

1074
01:19:54,753 --> 01:19:57,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's just over.
- To be the best of the best</font>

1075
01:19:57,548 --> 01:20:00,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">means you make mistakes
and then you go on.</font>

1076
01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:01,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just like the rest of us.</font>

1077
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:03,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you don't think I know that?</font>

1078
01:20:06,432 --> 01:20:08,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here to help.</font>

1079
01:20:09,685 --> 01:20:11,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, thank you.</font>

1080
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:17,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if I wanted help, really,
I would have asked for it.</font>

1081
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:25,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'm too late.</font>

1082
01:20:27,411 --> 01:20:29,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've already left.</font>

1083
01:20:31,332 --> 01:20:33,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't learn a damn thing, did you?</font>

1084
01:20:34,668 --> 01:20:36,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except to quit.</font>

1085
01:20:39,631 --> 01:20:42,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got that maneuver down
real well.</font>

1086
01:20:50,392 --> 01:20:52,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So long, Pete Mitchell.</font>

1087
01:21:18,629 --> 01:21:20,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, hi, Maverick, come on in.</font>

1088
01:21:21,173 --> 01:21:22,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How are you doing?
- Good.</font>

1089
01:21:22,508 --> 01:21:23,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? You sure?
You sure you're feeling</font>

1090
01:21:23,759 --> 01:21:25,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- okay with everything?
- Oh, I feel great.</font>

1091
01:21:25,386 --> 01:21:27,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jamie, come on. Can I get you a drink</font>

1092
01:21:27,513 --> 01:21:29,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- or anything else like that?
- No, thank you.</font>

1093
01:21:29,598 --> 01:21:30,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, well, why don't you just...</font>

1094
01:21:30,724 --> 01:21:32,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you very much.
- Make yourself comfortable</font>

1095
01:21:32,184 --> 01:21:34,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- because Mike will be right down, okay?
- Great, thank you.</font>

1096
01:21:54,164 --> 01:21:55,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I flew with your old man.</font>

1097
01:21:56,125 --> 01:21:58,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">VF-51, The Oriskany.</font>

1098
01:22:01,463 --> 01:22:03,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a lot like he was.</font>

1099
01:22:03,924 --> 01:22:05,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only better</font>

1100
01:22:06,802 --> 01:22:08,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and worse.</font>

1101
01:22:09,888 --> 01:22:12,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was a natural heroic
son of a bitch, that one.</font>

1102
01:22:17,396 --> 01:22:18,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he did do it right.</font>

1103
01:22:23,694 --> 01:22:25,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, he did it right.</font>

1104
01:22:35,873 --> 01:22:38,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that why you fly the way you do?</font>

1105
01:22:38,183 --> 01:22:39,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trying to prove something?</font>

1106
01:22:42,379 --> 01:22:44,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, your old man did it right.</font>

1107
01:22:46,133 --> 01:22:48,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I'm about to tell you is classified.</font>

1108
01:22:48,677 --> 01:22:50,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It could end my career.</font>

1109
01:22:50,429 --> 01:22:53,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were in the worst dogfight
I ever dreamed of.</font>

1110
01:22:54,808 --> 01:22:57,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bogies like fireflies all over the sky.</font>

1111
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:02,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His F-4 was hit, he was wounded,
but he could've made it back.</font>

1112
01:23:02,566 --> 01:23:05,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He stayed in it,
saved 3 planes before he bought it.</font>

1113
01:23:08,947 --> 01:23:10,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How come I never heard that before?</font>

1114
01:23:10,365 --> 01:23:12,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, that's not something
the state department tells dependents</font>

1115
01:23:12,868 --> 01:23:15,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when the battle occurred
over the wrong line</font>

1116
01:23:15,621 --> 01:23:16,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on some map.</font>

1117
01:23:18,207 --> 01:23:19,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you were there?</font>

1118
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:21,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was there.</font>

1119
01:23:22,711 --> 01:23:24,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's on your mind?</font>

1120
01:23:25,797 --> 01:23:27,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My options, sir.</font>

1121
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:29,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Simple.</font>

1122
01:23:31,386 --> 01:23:33,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First, you've acquired enough
points to show up tomorrow</font>

1123
01:23:33,931 --> 01:23:36,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and graduate with your top gun class.</font>

1124
01:23:37,059 --> 01:23:38,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or you can quit.</font>

1125
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:41,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There'd be no disgrace.</font>

1126
01:23:41,709 --> 01:23:43,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's been was hell I wouldn't shook me up.</font>

1127
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:45,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you think I should quit?</font>

1128
01:23:46,276 --> 01:23:47,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't say that.</font>

1129
01:23:49,655 --> 01:23:52,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The simple fact is,
you feel responsible for Goose,</font>

1130
01:23:52,824 --> 01:23:55,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you have a confidence problem.</font>

1131
01:23:56,495 --> 01:23:59,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I'm not gonna sit here and blow
sunshine up your ass, lieutenant.</font>

1132
01:23:59,748 --> 01:24:03,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A good pilot is compelled to
always evaluate what's happened.</font>

1133
01:24:04,545 --> 01:24:06,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he can apply what he's learnt.</font>

1134
01:24:07,839 --> 01:24:09,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up there, we gotta push it.</font>

1135
01:24:11,134 --> 01:24:12,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's our job.</font>

1136
01:24:14,972 --> 01:24:18,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's your option, lieutenant, all yours.</font>

1137
01:24:30,946 --> 01:24:32,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir,</font>

1138
01:24:33,031 --> 01:24:34,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but thank you very much for your time.</font>

1139
01:24:35,075 --> 01:24:37,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No problem. Good luck.</font>

1140
01:25:26,793 --> 01:25:27,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen...</font>

1141
01:25:28,211 --> 01:25:29,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where's Maverick?
- Here at top gun,</font>

1142
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:31,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we challenged you
to fly against the very best.</font>

1143
01:25:31,465 --> 01:25:32,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know where he is.</font>

1144
01:25:32,716 --> 01:25:34,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, we ask you to take
that expertise...</font>

1145
01:25:34,426 --> 01:25:36,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what he's planning to do?</font>

1146
01:25:36,136 --> 01:25:38,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And keep the tradition alive.</font>

1147
01:25:38,388 --> 01:25:39,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotta be hard on the guy,
though, you know?</font>

1148
01:25:39,848 --> 01:25:41,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck.</font>

1149
01:26:12,381 --> 01:26:14,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Congratulations.
- Thank you.</font>

1150
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mav.</font>

1151
01:26:19,179 --> 01:26:20,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>

1152
01:26:23,141 --> 01:26:24,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen.</font>

1153
01:26:25,018 --> 01:26:27,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate to break up the party
before it really gets out of hand,</font>

1154
01:26:28,021 --> 01:26:29,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but there is work to be done.</font>

1155
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:32,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some of you have to
depart immediately.</font>

1156
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a crisis situation.</font>

1157
01:26:34,653 --> 01:26:35,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ice, Slider.</font>

1158
01:26:35,904 --> 01:26:37,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo.</font>

1159
01:26:37,197 --> 01:26:39,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hollywood, Wolfman.
- Yes, sir.</font>

1160
01:26:40,826 --> 01:26:42,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick.</font>

1161
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:43,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>

1162
01:26:47,457 --> 01:26:49,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick, you'll get your rio
when you get to the ship.</font>

1163
01:26:50,544 --> 01:26:52,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you don't,</font>

1164
01:26:53,004 --> 01:26:54,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">give me a call.</font>

1165
01:26:54,381 --> 01:26:55,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll fly with you.</font>

1166
01:26:58,468 --> 01:26:59,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>

1167
01:27:08,895 --> 01:27:10,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen, this is Bull's-eye.</font>

1168
01:27:10,939 --> 01:27:14,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The communication ship
SS Layton has become disabled</font>

1169
01:27:14,609 --> 01:27:16,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and has wandered into foreign territory.</font>

1170
01:27:17,028 --> 01:27:19,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A rescue operation is to begin
within the hour.</font>

1171
01:27:19,448 --> 01:27:22,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mission is to give
air support to that rescue.</font>

1172
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:25,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are MIGs in the area,
and tensions are high.</font>

1173
01:27:25,787 --> 01:27:29,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you witness a hostile act,
you will return fire.</font>

1174
01:27:30,792 --> 01:27:33,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those MIGs carry
the exocet anti-ship missile.</font>

1175
01:27:33,253 --> 01:27:35,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They can fire that missile
from 100 miles away.</font>

1176
01:27:36,298 --> 01:27:38,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen, this is the real thing.</font>

1177
01:27:38,216 --> 01:27:40,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what you've been trained for.</font>

1178
01:27:40,552 --> 01:27:44,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are America's best. Make us proud.</font>

1179
01:27:44,473 --> 01:27:46,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ice.
- Yes, sir.</font>

1180
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:47,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hollywood.
- Yes, sir.</font>

1181
01:27:47,309 --> 01:27:48,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sector 2.</font>

1182
01:27:48,477 --> 01:27:50,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Maverick, you back them up
with Merlin on ready 5.</font>

1183
01:27:52,522 --> 01:27:54,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

1184
01:27:55,358 --> 01:27:56,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rise!</font>

1185
01:27:57,778 --> 01:27:59,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">excuse me, sir. Yes.</font>

1186
01:27:59,738 --> 01:28:02,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not personal,
but with regard to Maverick,</font>

1187
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is he the best backup that...</font>

1188
01:28:04,576 --> 01:28:06,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what's on your mind,
Kazansky, just get on it.</font>

1189
01:29:23,822 --> 01:29:26,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mustang, when you get the chance,
can you give me a mode-4 check?</font>

1190
01:29:26,074 --> 01:29:29,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Voodoo 1, you've got a pair
of bogies, 12 o'clock, 15 miles.</font>

1191
01:29:29,578 --> 01:29:33,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Voodoo 1, Voodoo 1,
090 radar contact 15 miles.</font>

1192
01:29:33,957 --> 01:29:35,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're doing 500 knots.</font>

1193
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:36,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roger, that's your bogey.</font>

1194
01:29:40,213 --> 01:29:43,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got them dead ahead, 15 miles,
air speed is 600 knots.</font>

1195
01:29:46,595 --> 01:29:48,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bogies' air speed, 650.
We're a little close together.</font>

1196
01:29:48,805 --> 01:29:50,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's take a wider split.</font>

1197
01:29:52,017 --> 01:29:54,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're at 15,000 feet now,
dead ahead, 10 miles.</font>

1198
01:29:54,811 --> 01:29:56,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Air speed is still increasing.</font>

1199
01:29:56,229 --> 01:29:59,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">800 knots.
Dead ahead, now, 8 miles.</font>

1200
01:29:59,357 --> 01:30:02,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dead ahead, now, 8 miles.
- Wood, you got them?</font>

1201
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:03,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not yet, I can't see them.</font>

1202
01:30:03,445 --> 01:30:05,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They must be close,
I'm getting a hard-on.</font>

1203
01:30:12,412 --> 01:30:14,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Wood, I'm taking the lead.
Let's identify them.</font>

1204
01:30:14,789 --> 01:30:16,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roger, Ice, you got the lead.</font>

1205
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:18,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm on your left side, a little low.</font>

1206
01:30:20,378 --> 01:30:22,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Maverick's up and ready in alert 5.
- Good, good.</font>

1207
01:30:25,342 --> 01:30:27,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hollywood, my bogeys still locked up.</font>

1208
01:30:27,552 --> 01:30:29,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's drifting to the left.</font>

1209
01:30:30,221 --> 01:30:32,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still maneuvering, course 090.</font>

1210
01:30:34,059 --> 01:30:37,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Wood, let's bring it to the right,
and we'll get a better angle on them.</font>

1211
01:30:46,404 --> 01:30:47,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ice, we got a problem here.</font>

1212
01:30:47,989 --> 01:30:49,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I'm breaking out
4 aircraft on the radar.</font>

1213
01:30:49,491 --> 01:30:51,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not one pair, two pair.
Repeat, 4 bogies.</font>

1214
01:30:52,077 --> 01:30:53,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wood, we've got 4 bogies.</font>

1215
01:30:56,665 --> 01:30:57,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wrong! Make that 5!</font>

1216
01:30:57,916 --> 01:30:58,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's 5, sir.</font>

1217
01:30:59,042 --> 01:31:00,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's 5?
- Yes, sir.</font>

1218
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:04,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit!</font>

1219
01:31:04,714 --> 01:31:06,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got a radar lock on us!</font>

1220
01:31:08,426 --> 01:31:11,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of there, Hollywood!
Get out of there, goddamn it!</font>

1221
01:31:18,561 --> 01:31:19,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Break left!</font>

1222
01:31:19,896 --> 01:31:22,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm hit! I'm hit! We're coming apart!</font>

1223
01:31:22,232 --> 01:31:23,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't control it! Hold on!</font>

1224
01:31:24,025 --> 01:31:25,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zero for 20! We're going down!</font>

1225
01:31:25,735 --> 01:31:27,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wood's been hit! Wood's been hit!</font>

1226
01:31:27,028 --> 01:31:28,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit! Wood's been hit!</font>

1227
01:31:28,571 --> 01:31:30,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Voodoo 1! Wood's been hit!
Wood's been hit!</font>

1228
01:31:30,782 --> 01:31:32,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've lost Hollywood!
Repeat, we've lost Hollywood!</font>

1229
01:31:33,076 --> 01:31:35,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We've lost our wingman.
- Launch Maverick on alert 5.</font>

1230
01:31:35,787 --> 01:31:37,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get a bearing on
Hollywood and Wolfman</font>

1231
01:31:37,789 --> 01:31:40,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and launch the rescue
helicopter immediately.</font>

1232
01:32:06,901 --> 01:32:09,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Maverick's airborne.
- Iceman, what's your position?</font>

1233
01:32:09,154 --> 01:32:11,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">090 at 180 miles.</font>

1234
01:32:11,531 --> 01:32:13,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we're coming in left!</font>

1235
01:32:13,658 --> 01:32:15,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 MIGs, dead ahead,
coming down the left side.</font>

1236
01:32:18,038 --> 01:32:20,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going after them.
I'm bringing it around to the left.</font>

1237
01:32:23,251 --> 01:32:25,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got 4 on our tail!
That makes 6 of them!</font>

1238
01:32:25,962 --> 01:32:28,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who do you think is hooking
in the guns range?</font>

1239
01:32:32,677 --> 01:32:34,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's firing! Break right!</font>

1240
01:32:36,306 --> 01:32:38,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mustang, this is voodoo 1,
we are totally defensive.</font>

1241
01:32:38,266 --> 01:32:39,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Launch the alert fighters.</font>

1242
01:32:39,434 --> 01:32:40,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where? Where are they?</font>

1243
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A hundred and 60 miles
and closing in fast, sir.</font>

1244
01:32:42,687 --> 01:32:45,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready Willard and Simkin
off cats 3 and 4.</font>

1245
01:32:47,817 --> 01:32:50,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick's supersonic.
I'll be there in 30 seconds.</font>

1246
01:32:50,153 --> 01:32:51,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move your ass! Get up here!
I'm engaged with 5.</font>

1247
01:32:51,988 --> 01:32:53,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Repeat, 5. I'm in deep shit!</font>

1248
01:32:56,326 --> 01:32:57,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about Willard and Simkin?</font>

1249
01:32:58,369 --> 01:33:00,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Both catapults are broken.
We can't launch any aircraft yet, sir.</font>

1250
01:33:01,289 --> 01:33:02,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How long?
- It'll take 10 minutes.</font>

1251
01:33:02,957 --> 01:33:05,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bullshit, 10 minutes.
This thing will be over in 2 minutes.</font>

1252
01:33:05,376 --> 01:33:06,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get on it!</font>

1253
01:33:08,505 --> 01:33:10,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1 MIG, 12 o'clock high!
1 MIG, 12 o'clock high!</font>

1254
01:33:11,549 --> 01:33:13,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch your back! Watch your back!</font>

1255
01:33:18,431 --> 01:33:19,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Break right!</font>

1256
01:33:21,893 --> 01:33:23,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, that was close!</font>

1257
01:33:23,436 --> 01:33:24,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick, how about
some help down here?</font>

1258
01:33:24,646 --> 01:33:26,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where the hell are you?
- Come on, kid, hang in there.</font>

1259
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:30,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ.</font>

1260
01:33:32,946 --> 01:33:35,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick, how about some help?
Engage, goddamn it!</font>

1261
01:33:37,325 --> 01:33:39,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick, we got a MIG on our tail.</font>

1262
01:33:42,163 --> 01:33:43,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch out! Watch out!</font>

1263
01:33:46,126 --> 01:33:48,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, we just flew
right through his jet wash.</font>

1264
01:33:50,713 --> 01:33:52,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get control, Mav! Get control!</font>

1265
01:34:00,265 --> 01:34:01,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good recovery, Mav.</font>

1266
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:03,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's get in there.</font>

1267
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:05,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, we gotta help ice.</font>

1268
01:34:05,728 --> 01:34:07,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's get back
in the game, Maverick!</font>

1269
01:34:07,814 --> 01:34:09,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on! Get in there, Maverick!
- No. It's no good.</font>

1270
01:34:09,941 --> 01:34:11,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's no good.</font>

1271
01:34:13,611 --> 01:34:15,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it! Maverick's disengaging!</font>

1272
01:34:15,697 --> 01:34:17,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it! Shit!</font>

1273
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:18,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it, Maverick!</font>

1274
01:34:21,911 --> 01:34:23,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get in there, Maverick!
You can't leave him!</font>

1275
01:34:24,789 --> 01:34:25,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Maverick!
What the hell are you doing?</font>

1276
01:34:25,999 --> 01:34:27,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talk to me, Goose.</font>

1277
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:28,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick, get in there, for Christ's sake!</font>

1278
01:34:28,251 --> 01:34:30,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ice is in trouble!
- Talk to me, Goose.</font>

1279
01:34:30,336 --> 01:34:32,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get in there, Maverick!
He won't last down there alone!</font>

1280
01:34:32,505 --> 01:34:33,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get in the fight, for Christ's sake!</font>

1281
01:34:34,048 --> 01:34:36,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick! Maverick!</font>

1282
01:34:39,345 --> 01:34:40,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick's reengaging, sir.</font>

1283
01:34:46,728 --> 01:34:49,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't get him off my tail!
- Ice, I've got your MIG dead ahead.</font>

1284
01:34:49,772 --> 01:34:51,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got him dead ahead.</font>

1285
01:34:52,775 --> 01:34:54,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good tone. I've got good tone.</font>

1286
01:34:55,111 --> 01:34:56,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got tone! I've got tone! Firing!</font>

1287
01:35:08,082 --> 01:35:10,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where? Where are they?
- A hundred and 55 miles.</font>

1288
01:35:10,668 --> 01:35:13,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 MIGs, dead ahead.
Closing at 800 miles an hour.</font>

1289
01:35:13,087 --> 01:35:15,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see them. I see them.
I'm gonna take them down the left side.</font>

1290
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god.</font>

1291
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:24,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ice is right below us.
He's got a MIG on his tail.</font>

1292
01:35:26,768 --> 01:35:28,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's firing! Break left! Break left!</font>

1293
01:35:32,190 --> 01:35:34,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He overshot! He overshot!</font>

1294
01:35:34,984 --> 01:35:36,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming in, Ice. I'm coming in.</font>

1295
01:35:39,364 --> 01:35:40,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got two MIGs dead ahead.</font>

1296
01:35:41,991 --> 01:35:44,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got him, Mav.
1 MIG passing between us.</font>

1297
01:35:48,665 --> 01:35:50,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a MIG on your left. On your left!
3 o'clock!</font>

1298
01:35:50,959 --> 01:35:52,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gonna fire, he's gonna fire!</font>

1299
01:35:59,801 --> 01:36:01,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick, check the guys to the north!</font>

1300
01:36:01,177 --> 01:36:02,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check the guys to the north!</font>

1301
01:36:05,431 --> 01:36:07,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Banking left. Banking left.</font>

1302
01:36:10,019 --> 01:36:12,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There he is. Get him, Ice. Get him!</font>

1303
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:13,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you guys, I'm coming in!</font>

1304
01:36:18,736 --> 01:36:20,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick, we got a MIG
coming around on our tail!</font>

1305
01:36:20,488 --> 01:36:23,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We gotta get out of here!
- I can't leave Ice.</font>

1306
01:36:23,157 --> 01:36:25,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's still coming around!
He's gonna get behind us!</font>

1307
01:36:26,035 --> 01:36:27,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not leaving my wingman.</font>

1308
01:36:30,832 --> 01:36:33,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm on his tail. I'm on his tail.
I'm going for it.</font>

1309
01:36:33,126 --> 01:36:35,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going for it.
I'm going for the shot right now.</font>

1310
01:36:35,128 --> 01:36:36,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roger. Engaged.</font>

1311
01:36:38,923 --> 01:36:40,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got radar lock.</font>

1312
01:36:41,009 --> 01:36:42,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good tone. I'm taking a shot.</font>

1313
01:36:42,927 --> 01:36:44,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Firel</font>

1314
01:36:47,974 --> 01:36:50,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">bingo! Wash that sucker, yeah!</font>

1315
01:36:50,351 --> 01:36:52,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ice, watch out.
There's a MIG to your right.</font>

1316
01:36:52,061 --> 01:36:53,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's firing!</font>

1317
01:36:55,106 --> 01:36:56,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm hit! I'm hit!</font>

1318
01:36:58,609 --> 01:37:00,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're hit! We're hit in the right engine!</font>

1319
01:37:00,236 --> 01:37:01,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm shutting it down!
I'm shutting it down!</font>

1320
01:37:06,451 --> 01:37:08,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming in, Ice. Coming in.</font>

1321
01:37:11,664 --> 01:37:14,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ice, that bogey's still behind you.
I'm maneuvering for a shot.</font>

1322
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:16,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with him, Mav, stay with him!</font>

1323
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take the shot! Nail him! Nail him!</font>

1324
01:37:17,962 --> 01:37:19,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. Ice, I can't get a tone.</font>

1325
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:21,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoot, Maverick!
I can't get him off my tail!</font>

1326
01:37:26,554 --> 01:37:27,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick, we're hit! We're hit again!</font>

1327
01:37:27,889 --> 01:37:30,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. Both engines are functioning.
We're okay.</font>

1328
01:37:30,183 --> 01:37:32,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ice, on the count of 3,
break hard right.</font>

1329
01:37:33,603 --> 01:37:34,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3,</font>

1330
01:37:34,729 --> 01:37:35,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2,</font>

1331
01:37:35,897 --> 01:37:37,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1. Break right!</font>

1332
01:37:40,777 --> 01:37:41,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Firing!</font>

1333
01:37:45,531 --> 01:37:46,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it, I missed!</font>

1334
01:37:46,866 --> 01:37:49,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let him go. Keep on him, Mav.
Keep on him.</font>

1335
01:37:49,702 --> 01:37:51,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got him. I got him.</font>

1336
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:54,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here comes a shot.</font>

1337
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:00,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scratch 3!</font>

1338
01:38:03,049 --> 01:38:04,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maverick, move!
There's a MIG on your tail!</font>

1339
01:38:04,592 --> 01:38:05,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a MIG on your tail!</font>

1340
01:38:05,885 --> 01:38:07,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got a problem here.
We've only got 1 missile left.</font>

1341
01:38:07,845 --> 01:38:09,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Approaching 110 miles, sir.</font>

1342
01:38:09,639 --> 01:38:10,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it.</font>

1343
01:38:10,932 --> 01:38:12,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got him! I got him! He's right on us!</font>

1344
01:38:12,266 --> 01:38:13,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's between our tails!</font>

1345
01:38:16,562 --> 01:38:17,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

1346
01:38:21,275 --> 01:38:22,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You haven't lost him. He's still with us!</font>

1347
01:38:27,031 --> 01:38:28,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?
You're slowing down!</font>

1348
01:38:28,574 --> 01:38:29,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're slowing down!</font>

1349
01:38:29,784 --> 01:38:31,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm bringing him in closer, Merlin.</font>

1350
01:38:31,244 --> 01:38:32,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna do what?</font>

1351
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is it, Maverick!</font>

1352
01:38:39,168 --> 01:38:40,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna hit the brakes,
he'll fly right by.</font>

1353
01:38:40,962 --> 01:38:42,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit! He's gonna get a lock on us!</font>

1354
01:38:45,925 --> 01:38:47,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now!</font>

1355
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:54,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a good lock. Firing.</font>

1356
01:38:59,313 --> 01:39:00,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scratch 4!</font>

1357
01:39:04,735 --> 01:39:06,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mustang, this is Voodoo 3.</font>

1358
01:39:06,654 --> 01:39:08,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remaining MIGs are bugging out.</font>

1359
01:39:23,337 --> 01:39:26,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mustang, this is Maverick
requesting flyby.</font>

1360
01:39:27,341 --> 01:39:29,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Negative, ghost rider.
The pattern is full.</font>

1361
01:39:32,263 --> 01:39:33,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.
Something I should know about?</font>

1362
01:39:46,611 --> 01:39:47,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1363
01:39:53,242 --> 01:39:54,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn that guy.</font>

1364
01:40:18,935 --> 01:40:20,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

1365
01:40:48,005 --> 01:40:50,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell happened
to you guys? Hollywood!</font>

1366
01:40:50,925 --> 01:40:51,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You!</font>

1367
01:40:55,763 --> 01:40:57,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are still dangerous.</font>

1368
01:41:01,686 --> 01:41:03,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can be my wingman anytime.</font>

1369
01:41:05,147 --> 01:41:06,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bullshit.</font>

1370
01:41:06,357 --> 01:41:07,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can be mine.</font>

1371
01:41:59,827 --> 01:42:01,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Maverick.
- Sir.</font>

1372
01:42:01,704 --> 01:42:03,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How does it feel to be on the front page</font>

1373
01:42:03,289 --> 01:42:05,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of every newspaper
in the english-speaking world?</font>

1374
01:42:05,875 --> 01:42:07,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even though the other side
denies the incident.</font>

1375
01:42:07,752 --> 01:42:09,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.</font>

1376
01:42:09,712 --> 01:42:11,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They gave you your choice of duty, son.</font>

1377
01:42:11,172 --> 01:42:13,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything, anywhere.
Do you believe that shit?</font>

1378
01:42:13,674 --> 01:42:16,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do you think you wanna go?</font>

1379
01:42:16,594 --> 01:42:18,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought of being an instructor, sir.</font>

1380
01:42:20,056 --> 01:42:21,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Top gun?</font>

1381
01:42:21,766 --> 01:42:22,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

1382
01:42:23,476 --> 01:42:24,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God help us.</font>

1383
01:43:45,224 --> 01:43:46,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Pete Mitchell.</font>

1384
01:43:51,897 --> 01:43:54,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard the best of the best
were gonna be back here,</font>

1385
01:43:54,108 --> 01:43:55,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so...</font>

1386
01:44:00,906 --> 01:44:02,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This could be complicated.</font>

1387
01:44:04,577 --> 01:44:08,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, on the first one,
I crashed and burnt.</font>

1388
01:44:09,999 --> 01:44:11,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the second?</font>

1389
01:44:18,507 --> 01:44:19,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know,</font>

1390
01:44:20,926 --> 01:44:24,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's looking good so far.</font>
