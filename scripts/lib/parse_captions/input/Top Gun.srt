1
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:27,634
Heading into twilight. Spreading out of wings tonight.

2
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:33,914
Got you jumping off the deck, shoveling the overdrive.

3
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:42,350
You take

4
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:43,194
a ride?

5
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:12,634
Morning, Scott.

6
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:22,270
Ghost Rider, this is strike. We have unknown aircraft.

7
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:26,514
Inbound Mustang. Your vector, zero 90 for bogey.

8
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:39,684
Who's up there? Cougar and Merlin and Maverick and Goose.

9
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:43,564
Great. Maverick and Goose.

10
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:55,912
Talk to me, Goose. Roger, I got him. Contact,

11
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:59,760
20 left at 30 miles. 900 knots closure. Cougar, you hear

12
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:03,436
that? Roger. Marlon, you got him?

13
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,676
Roger, I've got radar contact. I'll get a visual id.

14
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,064
Cougar, you hook him. Roger. And I'll clean him and fry him.

15
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:19,676
Mustang. Mustang, this is Ghost Rider,

16
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,068
203. I've got him inbound, bogey heading

17
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:27,140
270 at 10 miles. 900 knots closure.

18
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:30,256
Ghost Rider, take angels ten, left, 30.

19
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,964
Are we supposed to have visitors today? Negative, sir.

20
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:42,964
Call and see if he's a single. Roger.

21
00:05:45,264 --> 00:05:48,524
Goose, you see a trailer? Negative, Merlin.

22
00:05:49,424 --> 00:05:52,800
Looks like he's a single. Cougar, I'm gonna go head to head with him.

23
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:56,120
Take it easy, Maverick. I don't like this shit. I'm gonna brake high

24
00:05:56,152 --> 00:05:57,724
and right and see if he's really alone.

25
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:20,348
We got a thousand knots closure, Mav. It's coming right at us.

26
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:22,544
Okay, buddy, what's on your mind?

27
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:28,612
Holy shit, there's two of them. Big 28s.

28
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:31,836
No one's been this close before. What the hell are they doing here? What's the

29
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,412
position? Uh, 250 miles out, sir. 250 miles?

30
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:36,664
Get em out of here.

31
00:06:38,724 --> 00:06:41,144
Pookie, you've got MiG one. I'm going after MiG two.

32
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:44,384
I lost him in the sun.

33
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:49,294
Shit. What's he doing? You got him, murder.

34
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,094
He's coming around. He's coming around on our tail.

35
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:56,934
God damn it. This pokey's all over me.

36
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:03,374
What's the range now? 200 miles, sir.

37
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:07,090
They break 150 miles. Launch the alert five aircraft. Yes,

38
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:10,250
sir. Air speed,

39
00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:13,254
300. Go get him, Mav. I'm going for missile lock.

40
00:07:14,174 --> 00:07:17,766
See if we can scare this guy out of here. Come on,

41
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,834
lock up, baby. Lock up, baby.

42
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:24,394
Lock up. I got him locked. Bingo.

43
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:33,430
We got him, Mav. He's bugging out and going home. Mustang, this is

44
00:07:33,462 --> 00:07:35,194
Maverick. Big two is headed home.

45
00:07:36,574 --> 00:07:39,920
Alright, what's their position? 180 miles, bearing zero

46
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:41,124
10. Circuit.

47
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:47,472
Cougar, he's got missile lock on us. Get away from this guy. The hell is

48
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:49,004
this shit? He's engaging me.

49
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,512
God damn it. Mustang, this is Ghost Rider,

50
00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:56,768
117. This bogey's all over me. He's got missile lock on me. Do I have

51
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,884
permission to fire? Do not fire until fired upon.

52
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:05,136
Goose, there they are, right below us. The mink's in

53
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,906
perfect firing position. He's right on Cougar's tail. No way, Goose. He'd have fired

54
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,386
by now. He's just trying to piss us off. Maverick, get down here and get

55
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,814
this asshole off me.

56
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:19,522
Easy, Cougar. Bring it back, hard right.

57
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:22,986
Help me engage. I'm on my

58
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,574
way.

59
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:43,508
I can't shoot this son of a bitch. Let's see if we can have a

60
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:44,544
little fun with him.

61
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:52,024
Is this your idea of fun, Mav?

62
00:08:55,164 --> 00:08:56,064
Greetings.

63
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:02,920
Watch the birdie. Geez,

64
00:09:02,952 --> 00:09:04,444
I cracked myself up.

65
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,884
This is a great shot, Mav. I should be a photographer.

66
00:09:15,904 --> 00:09:19,644
Cougar, your tail is clear. Big one spooked out.

67
00:09:29,524 --> 00:09:32,636
Cougar, this is Maverick. We've had

68
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,820
enough fun for one day, don't you think? I'm getting a little

69
00:09:35,852 --> 00:09:37,664
low on fuel, so we're heading home.

70
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:42,104
See you on deck.

71
00:09:51,484 --> 00:09:54,304
Cougar, we're running low on gas. We gotta get out of here.

72
00:09:56,714 --> 00:09:57,654
Cougar,

73
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,854
we're on paper, Cougar. Let's do it.

74
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:07,774
Cougar. Come on, Cougar.

75
00:10:17,114 --> 00:10:20,246
Sneaking back to the ship, man. Come on,

76
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,486
Cougar. Get him on deck as soon as possible. He's got to be low on

77
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,430
fuel. Cougar, we gotta land this

78
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:30,754
thing. We are way low on gas, you understand me?

79
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:33,114
You alright, man?

80
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:42,634
Maverick, you're at three quarters of a mile, call the ball.

81
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:47,154
Roger, Maverick has a ball. Cougar,

82
00:10:47,194 --> 00:10:50,714
it's time to land. Goose, Cougar's in trouble. Come on,

83
00:10:50,754 --> 00:10:53,694
mav, we're getting low on gas. Let's land this sucker.

84
00:10:55,474 --> 00:10:56,494
Cougar.

85
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:06,850
God damn it, lyric, what are you doing, man? We've got no fuel for

86
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:10,866
this. We're going after Cougar. You tell him to

87
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,264
land that day. That's an order. Ghost rider,

88
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:17,124
you are instructed to land. Land immediately.

89
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:24,644
Any of you boys seen an aircraft carrier around here?

90
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,528
Man, if we got a little problem up here. That MiG really screwed him up.

91
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:31,284
I don't think he can make it back.

92
00:11:34,344 --> 00:11:37,562
You're okay, Cougar. Just stand my wing,

93
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:40,914
I'll take you all the way in. Just stay with me.

94
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:58,674
Easy, Cougar. Just a walk in the park, buddy.

95
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,234
You below your little oak. Cougar.

96
00:12:04,394 --> 00:12:05,974
Come on, buddy, pull up.

97
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:11,654
Pull up, Cougar. That's it.

98
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:13,054
Almost there.

99
00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:34,476
For too little, Cougar. For too little, Cougar.

100
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,164
Give me some power. Some more power.

101
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,664
Power damage,

102
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:50,624
come in,

103
00:12:53,644 --> 00:12:56,936
sir. Cougar, you should be in sickbay.

104
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,684
What's on your mind? My wife and kids, sir,

105
00:13:00,664 --> 00:13:02,964
almost orphaned him today. I've never even seen him.

106
00:13:06,064 --> 00:13:09,072
I don't know what happened up there, but I was so scared. Come on,

107
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,204
we've seen this before. No, sir.

108
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:17,004
I'm holding on too tight. I've lost the edge.

109
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:19,364
I'm sorry, sir.

110
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:22,304
I'm sorry.

111
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:30,104
Cougar.

112
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:34,464
Thanks, Maverick.

113
00:13:37,364 --> 00:13:41,304
Maverick, Goose, come in here. What the hell's going on?

114
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:44,784
I don't know. Shit.

115
00:13:49,104 --> 00:13:52,084
Maverick, you just did an incredibly brave thing.

116
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:59,320
What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane,

117
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:02,544
the taxpayers do. Son, your ego is writing checks

118
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:05,432
your body can't cash. You've been busted.

119
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:08,912
You lost your qualifications as section leader three times.

120
00:14:09,088 --> 00:14:12,476
Put and hacked twice. By me. With a history of

121
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,484
high speed passes over five air controlled towers and

122
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:19,624
one admiral's daughter. Penny Benjamin.

123
00:14:20,204 --> 00:14:23,972
And you, asshole, you're lucky to be here. Thank you,

124
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,540
sir. And let's not bullshit, Maverick. Your family name ain't

125
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:31,316
the best in the Navy. You need to be doing it better and cleaner

126
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,676
than the other guy. Now, what is it with you? Just want to serve

127
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,652
my country, be the best fighter pilot in the Navy, sir. Don't scream screw around

128
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,732
with me, Maverick. You're a hell of an instinctive pilot.

129
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:44,284
Maybe too good. I'd like to bust your butt, but I can't.

130
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:48,156
I got another problem here. I gotta send somebody from

131
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,572
this squadron to Miramar. I gotta do something

132
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:55,244
here. I still can't believe it. I gotta give you your

133
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:59,744
dream shot. I'm gonna send you up against the best. You two characters

134
00:15:00,404 --> 00:15:04,056
are going to top gun. For five

135
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,616
weeks, you're gonna fly against the best fighter pilots in the world. You were

136
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,564
number two. Cougar was number one. Cougar lost and turned in his wings.

137
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,920
You guys are number one. But you

138
00:15:15,952 --> 00:15:19,724
remember one thing. You screw up just this much.

139
00:15:20,104 --> 00:15:23,416
You'll be flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit out of Hong

140
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,084
Kong. Yes, sir.

141
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:33,264
That is all. Tell me about the mix some other time.

142
00:15:33,644 --> 00:15:36,852
Gentlemen. Good luck, gentlemen.

143
00:15:36,988 --> 00:15:38,464
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

144
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:23,932
During Korea and the Navy kill ratio was twelve to one.

145
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:27,868
We shot down twelve of their jets for every one of ours. During Vietnam,

146
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,460
that ratio fell to three to one. Our pilots become dependent upon missiles.

147
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,548
They had lost some of their dogfighting skills. Now,

148
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:38,304
top gun was created to teach Acm. Air combat maneuvering.

149
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:42,092
Dogfighting. This gives me a hard eye. By the end

150
00:16:42,108 --> 00:16:46,196
of Vietnam, that ratio was back up to twelve to one. Don't tease me lines,

151
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,866
please. I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to

152
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,754
our commanding officer at Top Gun. Very first man to win the Top gun trophy.

153
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:57,054
You will not find a finer fighter pilot anywhere in the world.

154
00:16:57,714 --> 00:17:00,574
Commander Mike Metcalf. Call sign, Viper.

155
00:17:01,274 --> 00:17:05,534
Gentlemen, you are the top 1%

156
00:17:06,034 --> 00:17:07,894
of all naval aviators.

157
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:13,134
The elite. Best of the best.

158
00:17:14,054 --> 00:17:17,534
We'll make it better. Fly at least

159
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:20,406
two combat missions a day, ten classes in between,

160
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,030
and evaluations of your performance. Now, in each combat

161
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:27,918
sequence, you're going to meet a different challenge. Every encounter

162
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:31,102
is going to be much more difficult. We're going to teach you to fly the

163
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:34,554
f 14 right to the edge of the envelope, faster than you've ever flown before.

164
00:17:35,014 --> 00:17:38,830
More dangerous. We don't make policy

165
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,954
here, gentlemen. Elected officials,

166
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:46,234
civilians, do that. We are the instruments of that policy.

167
00:17:47,174 --> 00:17:50,686
And although we're not at war, we must always act

168
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,990
as though we are at war. What are you doing? Tip of the spear.

169
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:57,806
Just wondering. Best be sure who's the best. In case some of

170
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,054
you wonder who the best is, they're up here on this plaque

171
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:04,846
on the wall. The best driver in his Rio from each class has his name

172
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,286
on it, and they

173
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,394
have the option to come back here to be top gun instructors.

174
00:18:14,014 --> 00:18:16,434
You think your name is going to be on that plaque?

175
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:20,974
Yes, sir. That's pretty arrogant,

176
00:18:21,014 --> 00:18:22,634
considering the company you're in.

177
00:18:26,254 --> 00:18:29,702
Yes, sir. I like that in the

178
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:33,090
pilot. Just remember, when it's over out

179
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:34,654
there, we're all on the same team.

180
00:18:38,794 --> 00:18:42,450
Gentlemen, this school is about combat. There are no

181
00:18:42,482 --> 00:18:43,854
points for second place.

182
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:47,574
Dismissed. He's going.

183
00:18:50,874 --> 00:18:54,894
The plaque for the alternates is down in the ladies room.

184
00:18:58,154 --> 00:19:01,394
Oh, Jesus. Oh, you kill me. You really do.

185
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:06,954
No, no, no. There's two o's in Goose, boys.

186
00:19:20,614 --> 00:19:24,206
This is what I call a target rich environment. You live your

187
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,772
life between your legs. Matt, go see if you can get laid in a place

188
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:31,196
like this. I'm telling you, I'd be happy to find a girl who talked

189
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,304
dirty to me.

190
00:19:37,124 --> 00:19:39,984
Matt, you want to know who the best is?

191
00:19:40,364 --> 00:19:44,356
That's him. Iceman. That's the way he flies.

192
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,820
Ice cold. No mistakes. Just wears you down. You get

193
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:50,864
bored, frustrated, do something stupid, and he's got you.

194
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:55,880
Hey. Hey, slider. Thought you wanted to be a pilot, man.

195
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:59,144
What happened? Goose, you're such a dickhead. Whose butt did you kiss

196
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:02,152
to get in here, huh? Well, the list is long but distinguished. Yeah, well,

197
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:05,152
so is my Johnson. So you're flying with Iceman,

198
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:09,048
huh? Mister Iceman to you. Hey, mother Goose, how's it going? I'm doing good.

199
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:12,084
Tom, this is Pete Mitchell. Tom Kazanski.

200
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:16,192
Congratulations on Top Gun. Thank you. Sorry to hear about Cougar.

201
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,376
He and I were like brothers. In flight school. He was a good man.

202
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,640
Still is a good man. Yeah, that's what I meant. Thought so.

203
00:20:23,752 --> 00:20:25,084
Say, you need any help?

204
00:20:26,944 --> 00:20:29,964
With what? You figured it out yet?

205
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:34,764
What's that? Who's the best pilot?

206
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:39,112
No, I think I can figure that one out on my own. I heard

207
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:41,364
that about you. You like to work alone,

208
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,604
mav? You must have sold under a lucky star, huh? I mean, first the MiG,

209
00:20:47,644 --> 00:20:50,980
and then you guys slide into cougar spot. We didn't slide into cougar spot.

210
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:53,772
It was ours, okay? Yeah, well, some pilots wait their whole career just to see

211
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:56,804
him make up close. Guess you guys are lucky and famous,

212
00:20:56,844 --> 00:20:58,624
huh? No, you mean notorious.

213
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:02,624
I'll see you later. You can count on it.

214
00:21:04,124 --> 00:21:07,716
They were abused children. We're gonna

215
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,964
have a good time. Time? Always.

216
00:21:13,224 --> 00:21:17,032
Okay, I guess it's my turn, isn't it? All right,

217
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:21,088
the bet is $20. $20? You have to have carnal

218
00:21:21,136 --> 00:21:23,604
knowledge, of a lady this time,

219
00:21:24,224 --> 00:21:26,444
on the premises. On the premises.

220
00:21:28,024 --> 00:21:31,480
Come on, mav, that's a bet. I don't know.

221
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:35,182
It just doesn't seem fair. For you, I mean.

222
00:21:35,318 --> 00:21:38,646
But, uh. She's lost that loving

223
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,334
feeling. She's like. No, she hasn't. Yes, she has. She has not

224
00:21:42,374 --> 00:21:44,954
lost that love. Cause she's lost it. Matt. Come on.

225
00:21:45,774 --> 00:21:47,434
I hate it when she does that.

226
00:21:53,694 --> 00:21:57,354
Excuse me, miss. Hey, hey. Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

227
00:21:58,414 --> 00:22:02,378
You never close your. Your eyes anymore.

228
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:05,734
When I kiss your lips.

229
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:09,538
There's no tenderness like before

230
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:12,854
in your fingertips.

231
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:16,594
You're trying hard not to show it,

232
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:20,294
baby. But, baby,

233
00:22:20,794 --> 00:22:23,974
believe me, I know I did.

234
00:22:24,514 --> 00:22:25,654
You've lost.

235
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:36,416
You lost that love and feeling.

236
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,160
Now it's gone, gone,

237
00:22:39,352 --> 00:22:42,604
gone. Whoa, whoa.

238
00:22:47,504 --> 00:22:50,044
Sit down. I do.

239
00:22:51,684 --> 00:22:55,388
Save it, baby. I'll give down all my knees

240
00:22:55,556 --> 00:22:59,452
for you. I love

241
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:02,584
that song. I've never seen that approach.

242
00:23:03,724 --> 00:23:08,492
How long have you two been doing this act? Oh, I don't know. Since puberty?

243
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:12,220
Right. Puberty. I'm Charlotte Blackwood.

244
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:15,692
I'm Maverick. Maverick. Does your

245
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:19,124
mother not like you or something? No, it's my call sign.

246
00:23:19,904 --> 00:23:22,964
Pilot. That's right. A naval aviator.

247
00:23:24,224 --> 00:23:27,600
No, actually, you've only done this twice. Oh,

248
00:23:27,632 --> 00:23:31,032
how'd you do? Crashed and burned on

249
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:34,704
the first one. It wasn't pretty. Second?

250
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:37,804
I don't know. I'll tell you tomorrow. But it's looking good so far.

251
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:44,638
Well, Maverick. Look, my friend's just

252
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:47,758
arrived, so it's been great talking to you. Perry.

253
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:51,554
Hi. Hi. Here you go. Oh, I'll be with you in just a second.

254
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:57,674
Listen, can I ask you a personal question?

255
00:23:58,294 --> 00:24:01,622
That depends. Are you

256
00:24:01,678 --> 00:24:05,470
a good pilot? I can

257
00:24:05,502 --> 00:24:07,794
hold my own. Great.

258
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:12,774
Then I won't have to worry about you making your living as a singer.

259
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:22,294
I'm gonna need a beer to put these flames out, yo.

260
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:25,974
It's great, mav. Real slick.

261
00:24:50,214 --> 00:24:53,754
It's a long cruise, was it, sailor? It's too long.

262
00:24:54,654 --> 00:24:57,446
What'd you want to do, just drop right down on the tile and go for

263
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,394
it? I had this

264
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:04,642
counter in mind. That would be very,

265
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:07,254
very comfortable. Yeah, it could be.

266
00:25:10,434 --> 00:25:14,442
Actually, I came in here to save you from making a

267
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:17,974
big mistake with that older guy. Really?

268
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:23,134
So I could go onto a bigger one with a young guy like yourself?

269
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:29,238
Maybe. No. I've got to

270
00:25:29,246 --> 00:25:32,314
be at work very early in the morning. What are you doing here?

271
00:25:34,294 --> 00:25:36,034
Your friend was magnificent.

272
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:42,474
No.

273
00:25:45,054 --> 00:25:49,062
Now, you'll also be trained and evaluated by a few civilian specialists.

274
00:25:49,238 --> 00:25:53,494
Civilians are here because they are our very best source of information on enemy aircraft.

275
00:25:53,914 --> 00:25:57,730
One of the most qualified is our tag rep, callsign Charlie.

276
00:25:57,882 --> 00:26:01,354
She has a PhD in astrophysics, and she's also a civilian

277
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:04,786
contractor. So you do not salute her. But you better listen to her,

278
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:08,354
because the Pentagon listens to her about your proficiency. It's all yours, Charlie.

279
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:11,974
Thank you. Hello.

280
00:26:12,514 --> 00:26:15,962
We will be dealing with f five s and a four s as our

281
00:26:15,978 --> 00:26:19,574
mixed simulators. Now then, as most of you know,

282
00:26:19,734 --> 00:26:22,782
the f five doesn't have the thrust to weight ratio that

283
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,006
the MiG 28 has. And it doesn't bleed energy

284
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,502
below 300 knots like the MiG 28.

285
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:32,086
However, the MiG 28 does have a

286
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:35,630
problem with its inverted flight tanks. It won't do a

287
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:39,654
negative g pushover. The latest intelligence tells

288
00:26:39,694 --> 00:26:42,354
us that the most it will do is one negative.

289
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:47,386
Excuse me, lieutenant. Is there something wrong?

290
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,254
Yes, ma'am. The data on the MiG is inaccurate.

291
00:26:51,714 --> 00:26:55,066
How's that, lieutenant? Well, I just happened

292
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,770
to see a MiG 28. We do. We? Sorry,

293
00:26:57,802 --> 00:27:01,066
goose. We happen to see a MiG 28

294
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,770
do a 4G negative dive. Where did

295
00:27:04,802 --> 00:27:08,102
you see this? That's classified.

296
00:27:08,258 --> 00:27:11,114
It's what? It's classified.

297
00:27:11,854 --> 00:27:15,422
I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. Lieutenant, I have top

298
00:27:15,478 --> 00:27:19,110
secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than

299
00:27:19,142 --> 00:27:22,830
you. Well, ma'am, it doesn't seem so

300
00:27:22,862 --> 00:27:25,654
in this case, now, does it? So,

301
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:29,030
lieutenant, where exactly were

302
00:27:29,062 --> 00:27:32,950
you? Well, we. Thank you

303
00:27:33,142 --> 00:27:36,196
started up on his when he pulled through the clouds, and then I moved

304
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,436
in above him. Well, if you were directly above him, how could you

305
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,744
see him? Because I was inverted.

306
00:27:45,084 --> 00:27:48,344
No, he was. Man, it was a really great move. She was inverted.

307
00:27:49,804 --> 00:27:53,132
You were in a 4G inverted dive with

308
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:55,744
a MiG 28? Yes, ma'am.

309
00:27:56,044 --> 00:27:59,544
At what range? No, about 2 meters.

310
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:02,168
Well, it's actually about one and a half. I think it was one and a

311
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,992
half. I've got a great Polaroid of it. And he's right. There must be one

312
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:07,404
and a half. Was a nice picture. He wasn't half a picture. Lieutenant,

313
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:11,884
what were you doing there?

314
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:16,624
Communicating. Communicating. Keeping up foreign

315
00:28:16,664 --> 00:28:20,204
relations. I was, you know, giving him the bird.

316
00:28:21,904 --> 00:28:24,824
You know, the finger? Yes, I know the finger, Goose.

317
00:28:24,944 --> 00:28:26,404
I'm sorry. I hate it when.

318
00:28:28,734 --> 00:28:32,114
Excuse me. So you're the one.

319
00:28:33,374 --> 00:28:36,590
Yes, ma'am. All right, gentlemen,

320
00:28:36,622 --> 00:28:40,766
we have a hop to take. The hard deck on this hop will be 10,000ft.

321
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,194
There'll be no engagement below that. Move it,

322
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:50,434
lieutenant.

323
00:28:52,794 --> 00:28:55,754
Okay. Well, don't be late again. You look great, honey. Thanks,

324
00:28:55,794 --> 00:28:59,146
dear. See you in pre flight. Lieutenant.

325
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,962
Why didn't you tell me that you were a famous Miggin sultan? Would it

326
00:29:02,978 --> 00:29:07,454
made any difference? Not in the ladies room, no. What would have?

327
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:12,114
I'm an instructor at this school. I see 20 new hot shots every

328
00:29:12,154 --> 00:29:14,934
eight weeks. Now, I'm sure you can figure that out.

329
00:29:15,234 --> 00:29:18,950
Look, lieutenant, I'd just really like to hear

330
00:29:18,982 --> 00:29:23,274
about the nibs sometime. We've got security clearance.

331
00:29:24,294 --> 00:29:25,634
You can read about it.

332
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:35,914
Maverick. I'm curious.

333
00:29:37,254 --> 00:29:40,622
Who was covering cougar

334
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:43,344
while you were showboating with this migration?

335
00:29:43,874 --> 00:29:47,374
Cougar was doing just fine. Uh huh.

336
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:51,450
Gentlemen, this is your first hop. The jets you are flying against are

337
00:29:51,482 --> 00:29:54,970
smaller, faster and more maneuverable. Just like the enemy migs.

338
00:29:55,042 --> 00:29:57,934
The clock is ticking, and as of now, we are keeping score.

339
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:00,094
I lost him, Goose.

340
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:05,746
Show me what you got, kid. I lost him.

341
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,294
I'm looking, I'm looking.

342
00:30:09,714 --> 00:30:12,386
I got him. I got him. He's on our tail, coming hard. Yeah, I got

343
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,414
him. I got him. Here we go.

344
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:30,442
All right. Talk to me, Goose. He's still back there. He's closing in on us.

345
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:34,174
He's closing fast. You can run, kid, but you can't hide.

346
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:41,674
Jester. Let's see if I can give you a run for your money here.

347
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:49,154
Watch your mountains.

348
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:03,022
I still got him. He's still back there. Come on, mav. Do some

349
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:05,474
of that pilot shit. Yeah, I got him.

350
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:19,086
Come on, bring it. Right, dudes. I've had about

351
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,502
enough of this shit. When you

352
00:31:22,518 --> 00:31:25,714
hit the brakes, I'll fly right by. Okay, you're mine.

353
00:31:27,894 --> 00:31:28,714
Whoo.

354
00:31:33,964 --> 00:31:35,224
Jesus Christ.

355
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:42,204
Let's see what you got now, Chester. Okay, man, let's turn

356
00:31:42,244 --> 00:31:43,104
and burn.

357
00:32:00,854 --> 00:32:03,966
He's going vertical. So am I. We're going ballistic, man.

358
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,034
Go get him.

359
00:32:14,454 --> 00:32:17,126
He's going for the hard deck. Let's get down there first and nail him,

360
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,994
Mav. No way, Jester. You're mine.

361
00:32:36,634 --> 00:32:37,894
I got you now.

362
00:32:41,474 --> 00:32:44,850
Jester's dead. Jester's dead.

363
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:48,866
Yee haw. Get your

364
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,534
butts above the hard deck and return to pace immediately.

365
00:32:55,244 --> 00:32:56,304
Yes, sir.

366
00:33:02,964 --> 00:33:05,704
Tower, this is Ghost Rider requesting a flyby.

367
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:10,204
Negative, Ghost Rider. The pattern is full. No, no, mav,

368
00:33:10,244 --> 00:33:13,820
this is not a good idea. Sorry, Goose, but it's

369
00:33:13,852 --> 00:33:15,224
time to buzz the tower.

370
00:33:26,424 --> 00:33:28,884
Goddamn son of a bitch.

371
00:33:33,704 --> 00:33:35,244
They pulled the fire.

372
00:33:37,664 --> 00:33:41,096
Yee ha. Jester's dead. One pissed.

373
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,020
Bullshit. Didn't everybody? Hell, no, man. We got our butts kicked.

374
00:33:45,152 --> 00:33:48,596
30 seconds. We went like this, he went like that. I said

375
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,464
to Hollywood, where'd he go? Hollywood said, when? Who go?

376
00:33:53,124 --> 00:33:55,900
Yeah, and he's laughing at us. Right on the radio, he's laughing at us.

377
00:33:55,932 --> 00:33:59,584
No, it's me laughing, dickhead. We won. All right,

378
00:34:01,044 --> 00:34:04,676
they won two, man. That's not what I heard. No, we did.

379
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,852
We got gesture. No, no, below the hard deck

380
00:34:07,868 --> 00:34:11,184
does not count. Hard deck, my ass. We nailed that sentiment.

381
00:34:11,504 --> 00:34:13,672
You guys really are cowboys. What's your problem,

382
00:34:13,728 --> 00:34:17,624
Kazansky? You're everyone's

383
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:21,624
problem. That's because every time you go up in the air, you're unsafe.

384
00:34:21,784 --> 00:34:24,524
I don't like you because you're dangerous. That's right,

385
00:34:25,224 --> 00:34:28,480
ice man. I am

386
00:34:28,512 --> 00:34:29,324
dangerous.

387
00:34:32,424 --> 00:34:35,800
Maverick, you and Goose get your butts out of that flight.

388
00:34:35,832 --> 00:34:37,643
Gearing up the viper's office now.

389
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:44,963
Remember, boys, no points for second place.

390
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,551
You're a lot brighter than you look. Oh, you shut up. Okay, don't worry.

391
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:52,047
Okay, I will. Don't worry. Two of your snot nose jockeys at a

392
00:34:52,055 --> 00:34:54,919
flyby on my tower and over 400 nuts.

393
00:34:55,031 --> 00:34:58,083
I want somebody's butt. I want it now. I'm at it.

394
00:34:58,783 --> 00:35:02,243
Oh, God damn it, Hatch. Twice.

395
00:35:02,724 --> 00:35:04,224
I want some butts.

396
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:08,544
Well, I don't. Just about COVID the flat buys.

397
00:35:09,604 --> 00:35:10,704
Follow me,

398
00:35:15,524 --> 00:35:19,172
gentlemen. You had

399
00:35:19,188 --> 00:35:20,464
a hell of a first day.

400
00:35:24,244 --> 00:35:28,196
The hard deck for this hop was 10,000ft. You knew

401
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,022
it, you broke it. You followed Commander Heatherly below

402
00:35:32,118 --> 00:35:34,594
after he lost sight of you and called no joy.

403
00:35:36,454 --> 00:35:40,270
Why? Sir, I had

404
00:35:40,422 --> 00:35:43,766
Commander Heatherly in my sights. He saw me

405
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:47,474
move in for the kill. He then proceeded below the hard deck.

406
00:35:47,894 --> 00:35:51,206
We weren't below 10,000 for more than a few seconds.

407
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,794
I had the shot, there was no danger, so I took it.

408
00:35:56,674 --> 00:36:00,494
You took it and broke a major rule of engagement.

409
00:36:01,634 --> 00:36:04,894
Then you broke another one with that circus stunt flyby,

410
00:36:07,794 --> 00:36:11,378
Lieutenant Mitchell. Top gun rules of engagement exist

411
00:36:11,426 --> 00:36:15,090
for your safety and for that of your team. They are not flexible, nor am

412
00:36:15,122 --> 00:36:18,954
I. Either obey them or you are history. Is that

413
00:36:18,994 --> 00:36:22,190
clear? Yes,

414
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:22,794
sir.

415
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:33,034
Dismissed.

416
00:36:38,774 --> 00:36:42,954
Really enjoyed that map. Thanks a lot. Holy shit.

417
00:36:47,474 --> 00:36:50,602
Maybe I could learn how to be a truck driver. Mav, you have the number

418
00:36:50,618 --> 00:36:53,602
of that truck driving school we saw on tv? Truck master, I think it is.

419
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,826
I might need that spit nurse.

420
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,614
Report says it all. He's a wild card.

421
00:37:00,234 --> 00:37:03,134
Flies by the seat of his pants. Completely unpredictable.

422
00:37:04,034 --> 00:37:05,654
He got you, didn't he?

423
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:12,510
Yeah. Maverick flew

424
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:13,634
with his old man.

425
00:37:17,454 --> 00:37:20,870
Tell me one thing. You had to go into battle.

426
00:37:20,902 --> 00:37:23,274
Would you want him with you? I don't know.

427
00:37:24,254 --> 00:37:25,434
Just don't know.

428
00:37:38,554 --> 00:37:41,174
Still awake? Yeah.

429
00:37:44,434 --> 00:37:47,734
What's up? Can't sleep.

430
00:37:49,674 --> 00:37:52,930
You know, when I first realized that going to top gun, all I could think

431
00:37:52,962 --> 00:37:54,494
about was getting that trophy.

432
00:37:56,314 --> 00:38:00,386
I gotta be straight with you. Math right

433
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,014
now. I just hope we graduate.

434
00:38:04,294 --> 00:38:07,274
I got a family to think about. I can't afford to blow this.

435
00:38:11,614 --> 00:38:14,314
I guess I fly. My. Wasn't such a big hit, huh?

436
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:22,678
Look, man, I know it's tough for you. It wouldn't let you in

437
00:38:22,686 --> 00:38:24,874
the academy. Cause you're Duke Mitchell's kid.

438
00:38:25,774 --> 00:38:29,010
You have to live with that reputation. It's like every

439
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:31,854
time we go up there, it's like you're flying against a ghost.

440
00:38:34,154 --> 00:38:35,374
Makes me nervous.

441
00:38:40,794 --> 00:38:44,146
You're the only family I've got. I'm not gonna

442
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,894
let you down. I promise you.

443
00:38:55,774 --> 00:38:57,034
Get out of here.

444
00:39:14,374 --> 00:39:17,154
A rolling reversal would work well in that situation.

445
00:39:19,754 --> 00:39:22,914
If I reversed on a hard cross, I could immediately go to guns on him.

446
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:25,054
Yeah, but at this speed, it's too fast.

447
00:39:26,434 --> 00:39:28,214
It's a little bit too aggressive.

448
00:39:29,474 --> 00:39:30,654
Too aggressive?

449
00:39:33,314 --> 00:39:36,014
Yeah. I guess when I see something, I go right after it.

450
00:39:37,994 --> 00:39:41,242
You didn't tell me who you were the other night. You didn't give me a

451
00:39:41,258 --> 00:39:44,574
chance, did you? You deserved it.

452
00:39:45,894 --> 00:39:49,542
I know. But you

453
00:39:49,558 --> 00:39:53,434
were tempted to ask me out for dinner.

454
00:39:54,414 --> 00:39:58,070
No. No. I don't

455
00:39:58,102 --> 00:39:59,034
date students.

456
00:40:08,814 --> 00:40:12,810
I can see it's dangerous for you. But if the government trusts

457
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:16,054
me, maybe you could.

458
00:40:23,594 --> 00:40:26,294
It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.

459
00:40:40,444 --> 00:40:42,224
Crashed and burn, huh, mav?

460
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:47,504
Slider.

461
00:40:50,844 --> 00:40:51,904
You stink.

462
00:41:02,684 --> 00:41:06,086
Let's go. Okay. I step was a

463
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:06,714
ride.

464
00:41:18,414 --> 00:41:21,034
That's good. Come on. Come on.

465
00:41:33,044 --> 00:41:36,220
Come on now. Four to seven. Now. We can get them.

466
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:37,784
Guys are animals.

467
00:42:13,704 --> 00:42:16,324
Okay. Yeah. Stay down.

468
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:24,024
Come on. We won. We won.

469
00:42:26,404 --> 00:42:29,652
Just one more game. That evens it up. Come on, we can take it.

470
00:42:29,668 --> 00:42:32,156
No, we can't. We got it. I got some things I gotta take care of.

471
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:36,092
Take care of. Just one more game. Please. For me?

472
00:42:36,188 --> 00:42:39,424
Sorry. You're sorry? Come on. For me,

473
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:14,024
damn it.

474
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:35,784
What, no singing?

475
00:43:37,244 --> 00:43:40,484
Look, I'm. No apologies.

476
00:43:48,784 --> 00:43:52,920
If you don't mind, I'm gonna just take a quick shower while you're finishing

477
00:43:52,952 --> 00:43:53,724
up here.

478
00:43:56,024 --> 00:43:59,884
Yeah, I do mind. I'm hungry.

479
00:44:03,624 --> 00:44:06,784
And then I thought about it.

480
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:10,956
I thought, you know, Charlie,

481
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,756
he's a smart guy. Why don't you just tell him why you've

482
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,104
got him in? Well,

483
00:44:20,004 --> 00:44:21,144
it's the MiG.

484
00:44:25,804 --> 00:44:29,252
The MiG. You were the only pilot who's been up

485
00:44:29,268 --> 00:44:30,584
against a MiG 28.

486
00:44:33,984 --> 00:44:36,632
I'm trying for this big promotion at work, and if I get it, I'm not

487
00:44:36,648 --> 00:44:40,152
gonna be here much longer. Seems to

488
00:44:40,168 --> 00:44:41,804
me you've got it all figured out.

489
00:44:42,544 --> 00:44:46,232
Mm. Except you didn't

490
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:47,324
forget the wine.

491
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:54,056
Sorry. You always get

492
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,524
what you want? No, not always.

493
00:44:57,654 --> 00:45:17,038
Yeah, maybe relax about the. Make this

494
00:45:17,086 --> 00:45:20,958
music our

495
00:45:21,006 --> 00:45:21,594
friend.

496
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:28,174
My folks loved it. Never heard this in years.

497
00:45:30,314 --> 00:45:33,506
My mother used to call down from her room and have

498
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:37,554
me play this over and over again. I got so sick

499
00:45:37,594 --> 00:45:41,034
of it. Not her.

500
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:44,530
She just sit up there alone, just listening.

501
00:45:44,602 --> 00:45:45,214
Hours.

502
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:53,074
She died shortly after him.

503
00:45:54,614 --> 00:45:56,194
What happened to your father?

504
00:46:01,774 --> 00:46:05,254
I guess I kind of figured with your security clearance,

505
00:46:05,294 --> 00:46:07,114
you'd know more about him than I do.

506
00:46:09,894 --> 00:46:11,074
Get that far?

507
00:46:14,394 --> 00:46:15,974
Well, that's a big mystery.

508
00:46:17,794 --> 00:46:21,234
He disappeared in f 4, November 5,

509
00:46:21,274 --> 00:46:22,534
1965.

510
00:46:25,314 --> 00:46:28,894
The stink of it was. He screwed up.

511
00:46:30,634 --> 00:46:34,050
No way. My old man was a great

512
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:34,814
fighter.

513
00:46:39,014 --> 00:46:42,074
But who the hell knows? It's all classified.

514
00:46:45,294 --> 00:46:46,714
Somebody must know.

515
00:46:50,414 --> 00:46:52,834
Is that why you're always second best up there?

516
00:46:54,974 --> 00:46:56,674
You are direct, aren't you?

517
00:47:05,914 --> 00:47:07,294
Sorry I was late.

518
00:47:09,834 --> 00:47:13,734
I'm sorry for being direct. No apologies.

519
00:47:16,874 --> 00:47:18,694
This is gonna be complicated.

520
00:47:31,134 --> 00:47:32,274
Where are you going?

521
00:47:34,374 --> 00:47:35,794
Gonna take a shower.

522
00:47:39,974 --> 00:47:43,554
Thank you. Enjoy being here.

523
00:48:22,094 --> 00:48:24,714
It looks like you need another shower.

524
00:48:27,054 --> 00:48:27,794
Right.

525
00:48:34,654 --> 00:48:36,434
I'm gonna be honest with you.

526
00:48:38,534 --> 00:48:41,078
Your MiG sighting is really important to my work, but,

527
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:41,794
um,

528
00:48:47,514 --> 00:48:50,254
I don't normally invite students to my house.

529
00:48:51,314 --> 00:48:52,374
You're, uh.

530
00:49:00,674 --> 00:49:03,454
But please understand, I still have a job to do,

531
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:07,254
sir.

532
00:49:30,374 --> 00:49:32,234
I'm glad we got that straight.

533
00:49:51,234 --> 00:49:55,082
I told her how tough it is here, you know, my ass dragging like an

534
00:49:55,098 --> 00:49:58,682
old, tired dog. I told her that you didn't even have a woman here.

535
00:49:58,778 --> 00:50:02,226
I really. You know what she said? Well, he probably doesn't

536
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,614
have one. He's got eight.

537
00:50:19,854 --> 00:50:24,034
So, Maverick. Goose tells me you're in love with one of your instructors.

538
00:50:24,614 --> 00:50:27,542
Is that right? I didn't tell her that.

539
00:50:27,598 --> 00:50:31,874
She did. I can't. There was a secret.

540
00:50:38,694 --> 00:50:42,274
The bogey has good position right here. All right, freeze frame.

541
00:50:43,094 --> 00:50:47,062
Moment of choice. DF 14 is defensive. He has

542
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:51,310
a chance to bug out right here. Better to retire and

543
00:50:51,342 --> 00:50:54,794
save your aircraft. And push a bad position.

544
00:50:55,434 --> 00:50:59,354
Johnny, jump in here anytime now. You stay in that diamond

545
00:50:59,394 --> 00:51:03,082
another 3 seconds, the bogey's gonna blow you out of the sky.

546
00:51:03,218 --> 00:51:06,178
You take a hard right, select zone five.

547
00:51:06,346 --> 00:51:08,334
You can extend and escape.

548
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,774
You made a bad choice.

549
00:51:12,514 --> 00:51:13,414
Johnny.

550
00:51:16,154 --> 00:51:19,014
Aircraft one performs a split s?

551
00:51:19,354 --> 00:51:23,070
That's the last thing you should do. The MiG's right on your tail.

552
00:51:23,222 --> 00:51:26,582
Tree's there. Please. The MiG has you

553
00:51:26,598 --> 00:51:30,430
in his gun site. What were you thinking at this point? You don't have

554
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:34,554
time to think up there. If you think, you're dead.

555
00:51:35,054 --> 00:51:37,446
That's a big gamble with a $30 million plane,

556
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,234
lieutenant.

557
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:49,624
Unfortunately, the gamble worked. The MiG never got a clean shot.

558
00:51:51,164 --> 00:51:54,556
Maverick makes an aggressive vertical move here, comes over the

559
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:57,584
top. And he defeats the bandit with a missile shot.

560
00:51:58,084 --> 00:52:01,804
The encounter was a victory, but I think that we've shown

561
00:52:01,844 --> 00:52:04,144
it as an example of what not to do.

562
00:52:05,604 --> 00:52:09,332
Next. Gutsiest move I ever saw,

563
00:52:09,388 --> 00:52:09,984
man.

564
00:52:13,824 --> 00:52:18,124
Now then, this is a perfect example of a textbook maneuver.

565
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:42,184
Lieutenant.

566
00:52:43,884 --> 00:52:47,772
Lieutenant. My review of your flight performance and

567
00:52:47,788 --> 00:52:51,764
the task was right on, in my professional opinion. I can't

568
00:52:51,804 --> 00:52:52,584
hear you.

569
00:53:13,504 --> 00:53:16,968
Jesus Christ. And you think I'm reckless? When I fly,

570
00:53:17,016 --> 00:53:20,736
I'll have you know that my crew and my plane come first. Well, I'm going

571
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,208
to finish my sentence, lieutenant. My review of your flight performance

572
00:53:24,296 --> 00:53:27,512
was right on. Is that right? That is right. But I

573
00:53:27,528 --> 00:53:30,788
held something back. I see some real genius in your flying,

574
00:53:30,836 --> 00:53:34,236
Maverick, but I can't say that in there. I was afraid that everyone in that

575
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,956
tax trailer would see right through me. And I just don't want anyone to

576
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,704
know that I've fallen for him.

577
00:54:37,844 --> 00:54:41,788
Watching in slow motion as you turn

578
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:47,000
back take

579
00:54:47,072 --> 00:54:48,364
my breath away,

580
00:54:54,584 --> 00:54:58,444
my love take my breath away,

581
00:55:04,504 --> 00:55:08,200
my love turn my breath

582
00:55:08,312 --> 00:55:26,300
away hey,

583
00:55:26,332 --> 00:55:28,984
Mavericks. Yeah? Hear about ice?

584
00:55:29,844 --> 00:55:33,156
What's that? You want another one? Really?

585
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,664
Yeah. I feel the need.

586
00:55:37,384 --> 00:55:39,804
The need for speed.

587
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:47,328
Gentlemen, this is top 19. Multiple aircraft,

588
00:55:47,376 --> 00:55:51,232
multiple bogeys. Your training is half over. The competition for

589
00:55:51,248 --> 00:55:53,864
the top gun trophy remains tight. First place,

590
00:55:53,944 --> 00:55:57,244
Iceman. Second place, Maverick. Just two points behind.

591
00:55:58,824 --> 00:56:02,152
Here they are. 3 miles left, 10:00. I don't think they see

592
00:56:02,168 --> 00:56:05,674
us yet. Okay, I see two. A four is left, 10:00 level.

593
00:56:05,714 --> 00:56:06,934
Continue left turn.

594
00:56:16,034 --> 00:56:18,698
Good morning, gentlemen. The temperature is 110 degrees.

595
00:56:18,786 --> 00:56:21,866
Holy shit, it's Viper. Viper's up here?

596
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:25,066
Great. Oh, shit. Great.

597
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:28,826
He's probably saying, holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose. Yeah, I'm sure he's

598
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:33,542
saying that. That I've

599
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:36,794
got my eye in the northern bogey. Roger. I got the southern guy.

600
00:56:39,174 --> 00:56:41,194
Hollywood, you've got the lead. I'll cover you.

601
00:56:54,054 --> 00:56:55,394
Break now, Chester.

602
00:57:00,114 --> 00:57:04,054
Hollywood, we're losing piper. Let's just stay on jester. Roger, I'm on him.

603
00:57:07,794 --> 00:57:11,490
Goose, find Viper. He's out there somewhere. Stay with

604
00:57:11,522 --> 00:57:13,654
Hollywood, Mav. We're covering his wing.

605
00:57:15,514 --> 00:57:19,314
Goose, there's Viper. 03:00 low. Stay with Hollywood,

606
00:57:19,354 --> 00:57:22,194
Mav. Where is cover? Don't kill. You leave me, Maverick.

607
00:57:22,534 --> 00:57:26,114
Hollywood, you're looking good. I'm going after Viper.

608
00:57:29,294 --> 00:57:32,582
God damn you, Maverick. Mav, don't leave him.

609
00:57:32,638 --> 00:57:35,274
Goose, Hollywood's okay. I want Viper.

610
00:57:38,854 --> 00:57:41,114
Standby. Viper's coming down.

611
00:57:47,984 --> 00:57:51,232
Holy shit, we're head to head. I can't believe we're doing

612
00:57:51,288 --> 00:57:51,884
this.

613
00:58:06,464 --> 00:58:09,484
Rock and roll. Here's our chance. It's a big one, Goose.

614
00:58:11,544 --> 00:58:13,264
Come on. God damn it.

615
00:58:16,884 --> 00:58:18,464
Come on, man, keep coming.

616
00:58:22,804 --> 00:58:26,500
Okay, sidewinder missile selected. Come on, baby. Come on,

617
00:58:26,532 --> 00:58:30,104
baby. Come around, come around. That's it, that's it.

618
00:58:35,564 --> 00:58:38,992
Jesus, the sky's coming, coach. Where's he going?

619
00:58:39,088 --> 00:58:41,964
Come on, come on, come on. Keep coming, keep coming.

620
00:58:46,024 --> 00:58:47,324
Come on, Danny.

621
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:56,736
Damn, this gets good. Still close for

622
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,444
missiles, Goose. I'm switching to guns.

623
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,244
Come on, come on, come on.

624
00:59:06,044 --> 00:59:08,704
Stick with it, stick with it.

625
00:59:12,324 --> 00:59:16,144
Hold it. Goose, check our tail. Shit, there's Chester.

626
00:59:16,444 --> 00:59:19,064
Bingo, Maverick's dead. You're out of there, kid.

627
00:59:21,204 --> 00:59:24,556
Defense Department regrets to inform you that your sons are dead because they

628
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:27,716
were stupid. Great balls of

629
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:30,840
fire. Okay, knock it out, gentlemen.

630
00:59:30,952 --> 00:59:32,884
Let's go home. Fight for as the lead.

631
00:59:37,984 --> 00:59:40,644
30 seconds, Wolfman. I'm coming in.

632
00:59:41,584 --> 00:59:45,192
Shut up. God. Fuck knows. That was some

633
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:48,328
of the best flying I've seen yet. Right up to the part where you got

634
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,524
killed. You never, never leave your wingman.

635
00:59:59,364 --> 01:00:03,664
Maverick, it's not your flying,

636
01:00:04,244 --> 01:00:07,944
it's your attitude. The enemy's dangerous,

637
01:00:08,724 --> 01:00:12,548
but right now, you're worse than the enemy. You're dangerous

638
01:00:12,596 --> 01:00:16,140
and foolish. You may not like the guys flying with you,

639
01:00:16,172 --> 01:00:19,784
they may not like you, but whose side are you on?

640
01:00:28,704 --> 01:00:31,724
Well, at least Viper got Iceman before he got us.

641
01:00:32,824 --> 01:00:36,440
He still got a shot at it. That was stupid.

642
01:00:36,472 --> 01:00:40,280
I know better than that. It'll never

643
01:00:40,392 --> 01:00:41,324
happen again.

644
01:00:44,624 --> 01:00:45,484
I know,

645
01:00:51,244 --> 01:00:52,104
I know.

646
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:34,520
You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain. Think about

647
01:01:34,552 --> 01:01:38,284
your love. Drives a man insane. You break my way.

648
01:01:38,624 --> 01:01:42,256
Oh, what a thrill. Goodness gracious, great balls

649
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,444
of fire. Woo. Maverick, would you go fetch him?

650
01:01:45,864 --> 01:01:48,804
Doesn't he ever embarrass you? Goose? Hell, no.

651
01:01:49,144 --> 01:01:51,704
Well, it was the admiral's daughter.

652
01:01:51,864 --> 01:01:55,400
What? He told

653
01:01:55,432 --> 01:01:58,724
me all about the time you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin.

654
01:01:59,504 --> 01:02:03,080
Did he well, that's great. He tells me about all of them

655
01:02:03,112 --> 01:02:06,774
ever. Uh huh. How my little angel goose goes home early

656
01:02:06,854 --> 01:02:10,326
for church. And you, you always go home with

657
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:13,814
the hot women. All right. Thank you, Carol. I'm gonna go embarrass

658
01:02:13,854 --> 01:02:15,434
myself with Goose for a while.

659
01:02:21,454 --> 01:02:25,566
You shake my nerves and you out on my brain. Think back your love.

660
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:28,754
Guys, a man is saying you broke my will.

661
01:02:30,364 --> 01:02:33,264
Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire.

662
01:02:34,044 --> 01:02:37,212
I would love to be able to warn you off about Maverick, but I

663
01:02:37,228 --> 01:02:38,424
just love him to death.

664
01:02:40,284 --> 01:02:43,636
You know, I've known Pete for a lot of years now, and I'm

665
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:47,628
telling you one thing's for certain. There are hearts breaking wide

666
01:02:47,716 --> 01:02:50,944
open all over the world tonight. Why?

667
01:02:51,284 --> 01:02:55,624
Because unless you are a fool, a boy is off the market.

668
01:02:55,964 --> 01:02:59,140
He is 100% prime time in

669
01:02:59,172 --> 01:03:01,892
love with you. Hey,

670
01:03:01,948 --> 01:03:05,732
Goose, you big dad. That's me, honey. Take me

671
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:09,344
to bed or lose me forever. Show me the way home, honey.

672
01:03:11,124 --> 01:03:12,984
Come on, Brad, let's sing with the family.

673
01:03:15,044 --> 01:03:19,544
Awesome. You shake my nerves and you rattle my brave.

674
01:03:19,924 --> 01:03:23,484
We better love. Got the man. You both

675
01:03:23,524 --> 01:03:25,464
are willing?

676
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:29,804
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire. Woo hoo.

677
01:03:29,964 --> 01:03:30,704
Ow.

678
01:03:46,004 --> 01:03:47,024
Maverick,

679
01:03:48,984 --> 01:03:53,084
you big stud. Take me to bed or lose me forever.

680
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:11,040
Okay, gentlemen, this is hop 31. Two weeks to graduation.

681
01:04:11,232 --> 01:04:14,824
Top gun trophy still up for grabs, so every point counts.

682
01:04:39,024 --> 01:04:42,404
Never under tension. Big and unit taxing,

683
01:04:51,264 --> 01:04:55,000
riding through the danger

684
01:04:55,032 --> 01:04:55,684
zone.

685
01:04:58,024 --> 01:05:01,128
Well, it's bottom of the 9th, the score is tied. It's time for the big

686
01:05:01,176 --> 01:05:04,696
one. You up for this one, Maverick? Just a walk in the parking,

687
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,684
Kazansky.

688
01:05:09,784 --> 01:05:12,504
Contact. Multiple bogeys. One six, five,

689
01:05:12,664 --> 01:05:15,816
2 miles. Looks like they're going away from us. Oh, I see them.

690
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,844
Tally ho. Right, 02:00. I'm in. I'm in.

691
01:05:38,864 --> 01:05:40,964
That son of a bitch cut me off.

692
01:05:49,184 --> 01:05:52,512
Come on, come on. Jesus Christ. Ice, take the

693
01:05:52,528 --> 01:05:55,912
shot. Come on, ice, get the hell out of there. I can't get

694
01:05:55,928 --> 01:05:58,764
the angle. I'm too close for missiles. I'm switching to guns.

695
01:05:59,464 --> 01:06:01,244
Ice, fire or clear.

696
01:06:07,994 --> 01:06:11,666
Look at this. Jesus Christ, I can take a shot right here. I need

697
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:13,454
another 20 seconds, then I've got him.

698
01:06:18,994 --> 01:06:22,482
I'm moving in. I've got the shot. Come on, Mav, let's get in there.

699
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:26,282
Come on, Mav. Maverick's getting impatient. Ice, come on,

700
01:06:26,298 --> 01:06:28,974
take the shot. Ten more seconds, then I've got him.

701
01:06:30,674 --> 01:06:33,840
Come on, ice, get the hell out of there. Let's do it, Mav.

702
01:06:33,912 --> 01:06:37,176
Ice, come off high right. I'm in. Five more seconds. Come off

703
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,404
high right, Ice. I'm in. I'm off. Shit.

704
01:06:43,464 --> 01:06:46,684
We're in. His jet wash. Oh. Oh, shit.

705
01:06:49,224 --> 01:06:52,120
This is not good. Shit. We got a flame out, Mav.

706
01:06:52,192 --> 01:06:55,280
Engine one is out. Engine two is out.

707
01:06:55,392 --> 01:06:58,496
Bruce. I'm losing control. I'm losing control. I can't. I can't control it. It won't

708
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,554
recover. Shit.

709
01:07:02,694 --> 01:07:05,814
Couple it up, Mav, we're out of control. This is not good.

710
01:07:05,894 --> 01:07:09,334
This is not good. Mayday, mayday. Mav's in trouble. He's in a flat spin.

711
01:07:09,374 --> 01:07:10,594
He's heading out to C.

712
01:07:13,894 --> 01:07:15,526
Altitude 8000,

713
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:19,874
7006 words. Six fam.

714
01:07:22,454 --> 01:07:25,794
I'm head forward, Goose. I can't reach the ejection handle.

715
01:07:27,614 --> 01:07:31,054
Goose, you're gonna have to punch this out. I can't reach the ejection

716
01:07:31,094 --> 01:07:32,514
handle. Eject,

717
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:36,794
eject, eject. Watch the canopy.

718
01:07:54,434 --> 01:07:57,134
Go. Go. Oh, no.

719
01:08:00,474 --> 01:08:03,254
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

720
01:08:50,634 --> 01:08:53,738
Sir, let go of him. You gotta let him go,

721
01:08:53,786 --> 01:08:54,414
sir.

722
01:09:37,714 --> 01:09:40,814
How you doing? I'm all right.

723
01:09:43,674 --> 01:09:51,186
Ghost is dead. I know ply

724
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:54,174
Jet's long enough. Something like this happens.

725
01:09:55,594 --> 01:09:58,694
Here's my real. My responsibility.

726
01:10:02,134 --> 01:10:06,634
My squad. In Vietnam, we lost eight of 18 aircraft. Ten men.

727
01:10:07,894 --> 01:10:11,710
First one dies, you die too. But there

728
01:10:11,742 --> 01:10:15,262
will be others. You can count

729
01:10:15,318 --> 01:10:19,126
on it. You gotta let him

730
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:19,714
go.

731
01:10:23,454 --> 01:10:24,874
You gotta let him go.

732
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:45,214
I think maybe it was my fault.

733
01:10:50,934 --> 01:10:52,954
I don't know what the hell went wrong.

734
01:10:56,254 --> 01:11:00,434
I'd like to help. I know it's difficult.

735
01:11:05,934 --> 01:11:07,434
God, I want him back.

736
01:11:14,614 --> 01:11:16,634
I'll be here if you need me, okay?

737
01:13:10,304 --> 01:13:12,684
God, he loves flying with you, Maverick.

738
01:13:31,084 --> 01:13:34,984
He'd have flown anyway. Without you.

739
01:13:37,284 --> 01:13:39,744
He'd have hated it, but he would have done it.

740
01:14:01,784 --> 01:14:05,488
We find that the f 14 flat spin was induced

741
01:14:05,536 --> 01:14:08,324
by the disruption of airflow into the starboard engine.

742
01:14:09,064 --> 01:14:12,560
This disruption stalled the engine,

743
01:14:12,752 --> 01:14:16,628
which produced enough yaw rake to. To induce

744
01:14:16,676 --> 01:14:20,144
a spin which was unrecoverable.

745
01:14:20,524 --> 01:14:24,524
There was no way Lieutenant Mitchell could either see or avoid the jet wash which

746
01:14:24,564 --> 01:14:28,372
produced the engine stall. Therefore, the board of inquiry finds

747
01:14:28,388 --> 01:14:31,940
that Lieutenant Pete Mitchell was not at fault in the accident of the 29 July.

748
01:14:32,132 --> 01:14:35,916
Lieutenant Mitchell's record will be cleared of this incident. Lieutenant Mitchell

749
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:38,504
is restored to flight status without further delay.

750
01:14:39,844 --> 01:14:41,624
These proceedings are closed.

751
01:14:50,724 --> 01:14:52,664
Get him up flying, soon.

752
01:15:19,784 --> 01:15:23,072
Come on, kid. Come on. Get in there. Engage. All right, you got a bogey

753
01:15:23,088 --> 01:15:26,164
at 02:00 low, Maverick. You got the angle. Piece of cake, pal.

754
01:15:30,264 --> 01:15:32,404
Take the shot. Just take the shot.

755
01:15:34,684 --> 01:15:35,824
Time, Maverick.

756
01:15:47,044 --> 01:15:50,676
Hey, where the hell are you going? Uh, it's not good. It. It doesn't look

757
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:53,404
good. What do you mean, it doesn't look good? It doesn't get to look any

758
01:15:53,444 --> 01:15:54,424
better than that.

759
01:16:06,904 --> 01:16:10,440
Hey, man, we could have had it. Hey, we could have

760
01:16:10,472 --> 01:16:14,088
had it, man. I will fire when I

761
01:16:14,096 --> 01:16:17,644
am goddamn good and ready. You got that?

762
01:16:36,364 --> 01:16:40,044
You can't get back in the saddle. Won't engage. It's only

763
01:16:40,084 --> 01:16:43,904
been a few days. You know, he just might not make it back.

764
01:16:47,884 --> 01:16:49,344
Keep sending him up.

765
01:17:08,904 --> 01:17:12,384
Mitchell. I'm sorry about

766
01:17:12,424 --> 01:17:13,084
Goose.

767
01:17:17,524 --> 01:17:18,904
Everybody liked him.

768
01:17:24,924 --> 01:17:25,904
I'm sorry.

769
01:17:46,264 --> 01:17:51,240
Hi, it's Wolfman now.

770
01:17:51,272 --> 01:17:52,444
Maverick just quit.

771
01:18:15,564 --> 01:18:16,704
Excuse me.

772
01:18:20,764 --> 01:18:23,144
May I? Please.

773
01:18:30,844 --> 01:18:34,624
Um. I'll. I'll have what he's having.

774
01:18:35,424 --> 01:18:38,564
Hemlock isn't. Nice one.

775
01:18:44,064 --> 01:18:45,764
You weren't gonna say goodbye?

776
01:18:48,104 --> 01:18:51,564
I heard you got that job in Washington.

777
01:18:51,944 --> 01:18:54,804
Congratulations. Thanks.

778
01:18:57,264 --> 01:18:59,844
But I wasn't gonna leave without saying goodbye.

779
01:19:04,004 --> 01:19:07,584
It's good to see you. Thanks.

780
01:19:10,084 --> 01:19:13,556
Where you going? You don't even

781
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:16,988
have a ticket, do you? Listen,

782
01:19:17,036 --> 01:19:20,144
I've seen all the evidence, and it's not your responsibility.

783
01:19:21,444 --> 01:19:22,864
It's not your fault.

784
01:19:24,884 --> 01:19:27,524
You're one of the best. Best pilots in the Navy.

785
01:19:28,824 --> 01:19:32,084
What you do up there, it's dangerous.

786
01:19:33,504 --> 01:19:36,896
But you've got to go on. How?

787
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,824
You don't understand. When I first met

788
01:19:40,864 --> 01:19:44,324
you, you were larger than life.

789
01:19:46,864 --> 01:19:48,004
Look at you.

790
01:19:50,304 --> 01:19:53,556
You're not going to be unless you're going mach two with

791
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:57,144
your hair on fire. You know that. No, it's over.

792
01:19:57,444 --> 01:20:00,804
It's just over. To be the best of the best means

793
01:20:00,844 --> 01:20:03,924
you make mistakes and then you go on. It's just

794
01:20:03,964 --> 01:20:06,544
like the rest of us. You don't think I know that?

795
01:20:09,244 --> 01:20:10,744
I'm here to help.

796
01:20:12,524 --> 01:20:14,744
Okay. Thank you.

797
01:20:16,624 --> 01:20:20,204
If I wanted help, really, I would have asked for it.

798
01:20:26,424 --> 01:20:27,884
That's why I'm too late.

799
01:20:30,264 --> 01:20:31,564
You've already left.

800
01:20:34,224 --> 01:20:36,324
You didn't learn a damn thing, did you?

801
01:20:37,424 --> 01:20:38,644
Except to quit.

802
01:20:42,644 --> 01:20:45,224
You've got that maneuver down real well.

803
01:20:53,404 --> 01:20:54,904
So long, Pete Mitchell.

804
01:21:21,424 --> 01:21:24,960
Well, hi, Maverick. Come on in. How are you doing?

805
01:21:25,072 --> 01:21:28,168
Good. You sure? You feeling okay? Great.

806
01:21:28,256 --> 01:21:32,192
Jamie, come on. Can I get you a drink or. No, thank you.

807
01:21:32,368 --> 01:21:35,342
Okay, well, why don't you just. Thank you very much. Make you so comfortable because

808
01:21:35,398 --> 01:21:37,674
Mike will be right down. Okay. Thank you.

809
01:21:56,974 --> 01:22:00,834
I flew with the old man. Year 51. They risk any?

810
01:22:04,264 --> 01:22:10,104
You're a lot like he was. Only better and

811
01:22:10,144 --> 01:22:13,968
worse. He was a natural

812
01:22:14,016 --> 01:22:16,004
heroic son of a bitch, that one.

813
01:22:20,264 --> 01:22:21,764
So we did do it, Mike.

814
01:22:26,524 --> 01:22:28,104
Yeah, you did it right.

815
01:22:38,564 --> 01:22:42,504
Is that why you fly the way you do? Trying to prove something?

816
01:22:45,204 --> 01:22:47,064
Yeah, your old man did it right.

817
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:52,884
What I'm about to tell you, it's classified. Could end my career.

818
01:22:53,264 --> 01:22:56,084
We were in the worst dogfight I ever dreamed of.

819
01:22:56,744 --> 01:23:00,404
There were bogies, like fireflies all over the sky.

820
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:05,336
His f four was hit. He was wounded, but he could have made it back.

821
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,604
He stayed in it. Saved three planes before he bought it.

822
01:23:11,784 --> 01:23:15,320
How come I never heard that before? Well, that's not something the State Department tells

823
01:23:15,352 --> 01:23:19,634
dependents when the battle occurred over the wrong line. Some map.

824
01:23:21,094 --> 01:23:24,154
So you were there. I was there.

825
01:23:25,454 --> 01:23:26,674
It's on your mind.

826
01:23:28,654 --> 01:23:30,514
My options, sir?

827
01:23:31,654 --> 01:23:34,638
Simple. First,

828
01:23:34,686 --> 01:23:38,754
you've required enough points to show up tomorrow and graduate with your top gun class.

829
01:23:39,854 --> 01:23:41,154
Or you can quit.

830
01:23:43,014 --> 01:23:46,316
There'd be no discourse. Grace, that spin was hell. It would have shook me

831
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:49,620
up. So you think I should quit? I didn't

832
01:23:49,652 --> 01:23:53,356
say that. The simple fact

833
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:57,464
is you feel responsible for Goose and you have a confidence problem.

834
01:23:59,244 --> 01:24:02,484
Now, I'm not going to sit here and blow sunshine up your ass, lieutenant.

835
01:24:02,644 --> 01:24:05,940
A good pilot is compelled to always evaluate what's

836
01:24:05,972 --> 01:24:09,304
happened so he can apply what he's learned.

837
01:24:10,784 --> 01:24:12,604
Up there, we gotta push it.

838
01:24:13,944 --> 01:24:15,124
That's our job.

839
01:24:17,984 --> 01:24:21,444
It's your option, lieutenant. All yours.

840
01:24:33,904 --> 01:24:37,252
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir, but thank you very much for

841
01:24:37,268 --> 01:24:40,384
your time. No problem. Good luck.

842
01:25:32,684 --> 01:25:34,744
Challenged you to fly against the.

843
01:25:37,204 --> 01:25:38,784
You know what he's planning to do.

844
01:25:41,164 --> 01:25:43,184
Gotta be hard on that guy, though, you know?

845
01:26:15,064 --> 01:26:18,004
Congratulations. Thank you.

846
01:26:19,484 --> 01:26:21,184
Congratulations. Thanks, Pat.

847
01:26:25,964 --> 01:26:29,724
Gentlemen, I hate to break up the party before it

848
01:26:29,804 --> 01:26:33,036
really gets out of hand. There is work to be done. Some of you have

849
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:36,744
to depart immediately. We have a crisis situation.

850
01:26:37,444 --> 01:26:40,580
Ice, slider, yoke. Hollywood,

851
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:41,384
Wolfman.

852
01:26:43,664 --> 01:26:45,924
Maverick. Sir.

853
01:26:50,304 --> 01:26:52,644
Maverick, you'll get to rear when you get to your ship.

854
01:26:53,304 --> 01:26:56,884
And if you don't, give me a call.

855
01:26:57,224 --> 01:26:58,484
I'll fly with you,

856
01:27:01,224 --> 01:27:01,964
sir.

857
01:27:11,924 --> 01:27:15,548
Gentlemen, this is bullseye. The communication ship SS

858
01:27:15,596 --> 01:27:19,700
Layton has become disabled and has wandered into foreign territory.

859
01:27:19,852 --> 01:27:23,092
A rescue operation is to begin within the hour. Your mission is

860
01:27:23,108 --> 01:27:26,804
to give air support to that rescue. There are

861
01:27:26,844 --> 01:27:30,864
migs in the area and tensions are high. If you witness a hostile act,

862
01:27:31,244 --> 01:27:34,676
you will return fire. Those migs carry the

863
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:38,134
Exocet anti ship missile. They can fire that missile from 100 miles

864
01:27:38,174 --> 01:27:41,030
away. Gentlemen, this is the real thing.

865
01:27:41,182 --> 01:27:45,314
This is what you've been trained for. You are America's best.

866
01:27:45,774 --> 01:27:48,934
Make us proud, ice. Yes, sir.

867
01:27:49,054 --> 01:27:52,382
Hollywood. Yes. Sector two. Maverick, you back him up

868
01:27:52,398 --> 01:27:55,670
with Merlin on ready five. Yes,

869
01:27:55,702 --> 01:27:56,274
sir.

870
01:27:58,174 --> 01:28:01,358
Rise. Excuse me, sir.

871
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:04,810
Yes? This is not personal, but with regard

872
01:28:04,842 --> 01:28:08,026
to Maverick, is he the best? I know it's on

873
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:10,174
your mind, Kazanski. Just get on it.

874
01:29:24,414 --> 01:29:28,230
You'll see this tiger Mustang. We get the chance to give me a mode

875
01:29:28,262 --> 01:29:30,582
four check. Voodoo one, you've got a pair of bogeys,

876
01:29:30,638 --> 01:29:34,726
12:00, 15 miles. Voodoo one, voodoo 1090,

877
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:38,494
radar contact 15 miles. They're doing 500 knots.

878
01:29:38,614 --> 01:29:40,154
Roger, that's your bogey.

879
01:29:43,214 --> 01:29:46,404
Come, dinner. Head 15 miles. Airspeed is 600 knots.

880
01:29:49,424 --> 01:29:53,204
Focus jet, 650, roll. Close together. Let's take a wider split.

881
01:29:54,904 --> 01:29:58,272
They're 15,000ft now. Dead ahead, 10 miles. Airspeed is

882
01:29:58,288 --> 01:30:01,520
still increasing. 800 knots. Dead ahead now,

883
01:30:01,552 --> 01:30:05,032
8 miles. Dead ahead, now, 8 miles. Wood, you got them?

884
01:30:05,128 --> 01:30:08,564
Not yet. I can't see them. They must be close. I'm getting a hard on.

885
01:30:15,284 --> 01:30:18,516
Okay, Wood, I'm taking the lead. Let's identify him. Roger, Ice,

886
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:21,464
you got the lead. I'm on your left side, a little low.

887
01:30:23,244 --> 01:30:25,824
Maverick's up and ready. And alert five's good. Good.

888
01:30:33,044 --> 01:30:35,384
Still maneuvering, zero 90.

889
01:30:36,944 --> 01:30:39,672
Okay, Wood, let's bring it to the right and we'll get a better angle on

890
01:30:39,688 --> 01:30:40,244
him.

891
01:30:49,264 --> 01:30:52,320
Ice, we got a problem here. Now, I'm breaking up four aircraft on the radar.

892
01:30:52,352 --> 01:30:55,560
Not one pair, two pair. Repeat, four bogeys. Wood, we've got

893
01:30:55,592 --> 01:30:56,564
four bogeys.

894
01:30:59,304 --> 01:31:02,788
Wrong, make that five. There's five, sir. It's five?

895
01:31:02,956 --> 01:31:03,864
Yes, sir.

896
01:31:05,644 --> 01:31:09,424
Oh, shit. He's got a radar lock on us.

897
01:31:11,324 --> 01:31:14,304
Get out of there, Hollywood. Get out of there, God damn it.

898
01:31:21,404 --> 01:31:25,244
My glyph. I'm hit. I'm hit. We're coming apart.

899
01:31:25,364 --> 01:31:28,414
I can't control it. Oh. 90 for 20. We're good.

900
01:31:28,604 --> 01:31:32,402
What's been hit? What's been hit? Shit. What's been hit? Fudu one, Fudu one,

901
01:31:32,418 --> 01:31:36,174
what's been hit? What's been hit? We've lost Hollywood. Repeat, we've lost Hollywood.

902
01:31:36,874 --> 01:31:38,734
Launch maverick on alert five.

903
01:32:09,734 --> 01:32:13,102
Mavericks airborne. Iceman, what's your position? Zero 90 at

904
01:32:13,118 --> 01:32:16,790
180 miles. Coming in left three.

905
01:32:16,822 --> 01:32:18,594
MiG state ahead. Coming down the left side.

906
01:32:20,974 --> 01:32:23,514
I'm going after him. I'm bringing around to the left.

907
01:32:26,094 --> 01:32:29,662
We got four on our tail. That made six of them lead. Make us

908
01:32:29,678 --> 01:32:36,254
closer than the guns. Range firing.

909
01:32:36,294 --> 01:32:39,646
Break right. Mustang,

910
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:43,006
this is Voodoo one. We are totally defensive. Launch the alert fighters. Where? Where are

911
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:46,774
they? 160 miles and closing in fast, sir. Ready Willet and Simkinov

912
01:32:46,814 --> 01:32:48,054
cats three and four.

913
01:32:50,674 --> 01:32:54,122
Maverick, supersonic. I'll be there in 30 seconds. Move your ass. Get up here.

914
01:32:54,138 --> 01:32:56,894
I'm engaged with five. Repeat, five. I'm in deep shit.

915
01:32:59,114 --> 01:33:02,706
What about Willard and Simpkin? Both catapults are broken. We can't

916
01:33:02,730 --> 01:33:05,810
launch any aircraft yet, sir. How long? It'll take ten minutes.

917
01:33:05,882 --> 01:33:09,334
Bullshit. Ten minutes. This thing will be over in two minutes. Get on it.

918
01:33:11,394 --> 01:33:14,942
One big 12:00 high. Wanna make 12:00 high? Watch you

919
01:33:14,958 --> 01:33:16,034
back. Watch you back.

920
01:33:21,334 --> 01:33:22,314
Right, right.

921
01:33:25,014 --> 01:33:27,998
Shit, that was close. Maverick, how about the belt down here. Where the hell are

922
01:33:28,006 --> 01:33:30,114
you? Gun. Come on, kid, hang in there.

923
01:33:32,334 --> 01:33:33,594
Jesus Christ.

924
01:33:35,854 --> 01:33:38,474
Maverick, how about some help? Engage. God damn it.

925
01:33:40,234 --> 01:33:41,974
Maverick, we got a MiG on our tail.

926
01:33:45,074 --> 01:33:46,294
Watch out. Watch out.

927
01:33:49,074 --> 01:33:51,414
Shit, we just flew right through his jet wash.

928
01:33:53,634 --> 01:33:55,374
Get control, Mav. Get control.

929
01:34:03,114 --> 01:34:06,518
Good recovery, man. Okay, let's. Let's get in there.

930
01:34:06,646 --> 01:34:09,726
Come on, we gotta help ice. Come on, let's get back and

931
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:12,806
engage, Maverick, come on. It's no good. Get in there, Maverick.

932
01:34:12,830 --> 01:34:13,714
It's no good.

933
01:34:16,534 --> 01:34:19,542
God damn it. Maverick's disengaging. I knew it.

934
01:34:19,638 --> 01:34:21,954
Shit. God damn it, Maverick.

935
01:34:24,774 --> 01:34:28,078
Get in there, Maverick. You can't leave him. Come on, Maverick. What the

936
01:34:28,086 --> 01:34:31,682
hell are you doing, Maverick, get in there, for Christ's sake. Lice is

937
01:34:31,698 --> 01:34:35,066
in trouble. He's got no cover. Get in there, Maverick. You won't last down there

938
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:38,094
alone. Get in the fight, for Christ's sake. Maverick.

939
01:34:38,474 --> 01:34:39,414
Maverick.

940
01:34:42,194 --> 01:34:43,894
Maverick's re engaging, sir.

941
01:34:49,634 --> 01:34:52,858
I can't get him off my tail. Ice, I've got your big dead ahead.

942
01:34:52,946 --> 01:34:56,450
I've got him dead ahead. Good toad.

943
01:34:56,522 --> 01:35:00,254
I got good toad. I got toned. I got toned. Fire it.

944
01:35:10,954 --> 01:35:14,642
Where? Where are they? 155 miles. Two big stead ahead.

945
01:35:14,698 --> 01:35:17,482
Closure 800 miles an hour. I see him. I see him. I'm gonna take him

946
01:35:17,498 --> 01:35:21,210
down the left side. Oh,

947
01:35:21,242 --> 01:35:22,094
my God.

948
01:35:24,894 --> 01:35:27,514
Ice is right below us. He's got a MiG on his tail.

949
01:35:29,654 --> 01:35:35,390
He's firing. Brake. Laugh. Brake lamp here.

950
01:35:35,422 --> 01:35:38,342
Our shot here. I'm coming in,

951
01:35:38,358 --> 01:35:39,634
Ice, I'm coming in.

952
01:35:42,294 --> 01:35:45,582
Got two migs dead ahead. I got him,

953
01:35:45,598 --> 01:35:47,314
Mav. One MiG passing between us.

954
01:35:51,494 --> 01:35:54,854
You gotta make on your left. On your left. 03:00 he's gonna fire. He's gonna

955
01:35:54,894 --> 01:35:55,474
fire.

956
01:36:02,774 --> 01:36:05,554
Favor, get the guys to the north. Check the guys to the north.

957
01:36:08,294 --> 01:36:10,154
Banking left. Banking left.

958
01:36:12,894 --> 01:36:16,120
There he is. Get a mic. Get him. Okay, you guys, I'm coming

959
01:36:16,152 --> 01:36:16,724
in.

960
01:36:21,584 --> 01:36:24,760
Maverick, got a mink coming around on our tail. We gotta get out of here.

961
01:36:24,952 --> 01:36:27,776
I can't leave Ice. He's still coming around. He's still coming around. He's gonna get

962
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:31,204
behind us. I'm not leaving my wing band.

963
01:36:33,784 --> 01:36:36,488
I'm on his tail. I'm on his tail. I'm going for it. I'm going for

964
01:36:36,496 --> 01:36:39,244
it. I'm going for the shot right now. Roger, engage.

965
01:36:41,644 --> 01:36:45,692
I've got ready to unlock. Good tone. I'm taking a shot.

966
01:36:45,868 --> 01:36:46,584
Fire.

967
01:36:50,964 --> 01:36:54,308
Bingo. Watch that sucker. Yeah. Ice, watch out, there's a

968
01:36:54,316 --> 01:36:55,944
mid to your right. He's firing.

969
01:36:58,004 --> 01:36:59,304
I'm hit. I'm hit.

970
01:37:01,484 --> 01:37:04,704
We're hit. We're hitting the right engine. I'm shutting it down. I'm shutting it down.

971
01:37:05,864 --> 01:37:08,164
Keep watching. Keep watching.

972
01:37:09,344 --> 01:37:10,804
Coming in, ice. Coming in,

973
01:37:14,464 --> 01:37:18,032
ice. That bogey's still behind you. I'm maneuvering for a shot. Stay with

974
01:37:18,048 --> 01:37:21,432
him, Matt. Stay with him. Take the shot. Nail him. Nail him. Shit.

975
01:37:21,488 --> 01:37:25,044
Ice, I can't get a tone. Shoot, Maverick. I can't get him off my tail.

976
01:37:29,424 --> 01:37:32,492
Maverick. We're hit. We're hit again. It's okay. All systems are functioning.

977
01:37:32,508 --> 01:37:35,824
We're okay. Ice, on the count of three, brake hard right.

978
01:37:36,404 --> 01:37:39,356
Three, two, one.

979
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:40,344
Brake right.

980
01:37:43,604 --> 01:37:44,544
Firing.

981
01:37:48,444 --> 01:37:51,532
Damn it. Fished, don't let him go. Keep on him,

982
01:37:51,548 --> 01:37:54,304
Mav. Keep on him. I got him. I got him.

983
01:37:55,684 --> 01:38:03,684
Here comes a shotty backstreet

984
01:38:06,424 --> 01:38:09,576
move. There's a MiG undertale. There's a MiG undertale. We've got a problem here.

985
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,512
We've only got one missile left. Approaching 110 miles, sir.

986
01:38:12,568 --> 01:38:15,504
God damn him. I got him. I got him. He's right on us. He's between

987
01:38:15,544 --> 01:38:16,444
our tails.

988
01:38:19,544 --> 01:38:20,364
Shit.

989
01:38:24,024 --> 01:38:25,964
You haven't lost him. He's still with us.

990
01:38:30,024 --> 01:38:33,696
What are you doing? You're slowing down. You're slowing down. I'm bringing him in closer,

991
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:35,244
Merlin. You're gonna do what?

992
01:38:40,464 --> 01:38:44,096
This is it, Maverick. I'm gonna hit the brakes. He'll fly right by. Shit,

993
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:45,524
he's gonna get a lock on us.

994
01:38:55,004 --> 01:38:57,024
I got it. Good luck. Firing.

995
01:39:01,524 --> 01:39:03,184
Whoo. Splash. Four.

996
01:39:07,364 --> 01:39:10,956
Mustang, this scoodoo. Three remaining migs are bugging

997
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:11,544
out.

998
01:39:26,194 --> 01:39:29,454
Mustang, this is Maverick, requesting flyby.

999
01:39:30,154 --> 01:39:32,254
Negative, ghost rider. The pattern is fault.

1000
01:39:35,034 --> 01:39:37,094
Excuse me. Something I should know about?

1001
01:40:58,534 --> 01:41:00,304
You are still dangerous. Dangerous?

1002
01:41:04,524 --> 01:41:06,624
You can be my wingman anytime.

1003
01:41:07,964 --> 01:41:10,584
Bullshit. You can be mine.

1004
01:42:02,684 --> 01:42:07,044
Maverick. Sir? How's it feel to be on the front page? Every newspaper

1005
01:42:07,084 --> 01:42:10,620
in the english speaking world? Even though the other side denies the incident.

1006
01:42:10,692 --> 01:42:14,164
Congratulations. Thank you, sir. They gave you your choice of duty, son.

1007
01:42:14,204 --> 01:42:17,964
Anything, anywhere. Do you believe that shit? Where do you think you want to go?

1008
01:42:19,504 --> 01:42:22,124
I thought of being an instructor, sir.

1009
01:42:22,864 --> 01:42:25,644
Top Gun? Yes, sir.

1010
01:42:26,344 --> 01:42:27,724
God help us.

1011
01:43:02,004 --> 01:43:06,196
You never close your eyes anymore.

1012
01:43:06,340 --> 01:43:09,364
When I kiss your lips.

1013
01:43:12,784 --> 01:43:16,304
There's no tenderness. Like grief.

1014
01:43:16,384 --> 01:43:19,404
Holding your finger. Tears.

1015
01:43:22,784 --> 01:43:26,164
You're trying hard not to show it.

1016
01:43:28,704 --> 01:43:30,204
But, baby,

1017
01:43:31,664 --> 01:43:33,524
baby, I must.

1018
01:43:34,924 --> 01:43:46,304
You lost. I love you.

1019
01:43:48,084 --> 01:43:49,264
Go keep it.

1020
01:43:54,724 --> 01:43:57,704
I heard the best of the best. We're gonna be back here, so.

1021
01:44:00,304 --> 01:44:03,552
Baby, baby, I'd get down.

1022
01:44:03,608 --> 01:44:05,284
All this could be complicated,

1023
01:44:07,344 --> 01:44:10,600
you know, in the first one, they crashed and

1024
01:44:10,632 --> 01:44:13,924
burned. And the second?

1025
01:44:24,604 --> 01:44:27,584
Don't find every day good so far.

1026
01:44:30,164 --> 01:44:32,664
So don't, don't,

1027
01:44:33,044 --> 01:44:41,664
don't, don't let us live away baby,

1028
01:44:42,844 --> 01:44:46,264
baby, I made you peace.

1029
01:44:49,444 --> 01:44:52,824
I need your love. Did I know I need?

1030
01:44:54,444 --> 01:44:58,584
Bring it on my, bring it on my head?

1031
01:45:00,644 --> 01:45:03,224
Bring back that love?

1032
01:45:43,444 --> 01:45:46,684
Heroes around the sun? Doesn't mean

1033
01:45:46,724 --> 01:45:48,384
that much to me?

1034
01:46:07,384 --> 01:46:10,524
Higher and higher in my soul?

1035
01:46:12,104 --> 01:46:15,648
There's a raging fire in

1036
01:46:15,696 --> 01:46:17,244
the sky tonight?

1037
01:46:19,184 --> 01:46:22,992
I wanna ride on the silver dome? Far into

1038
01:46:23,088 --> 01:46:27,144
the night? Can I make you take

1039
01:46:27,264 --> 01:46:28,884
me out?

1040
01:46:33,244 --> 01:46:34,984
Me? I?

1041
01:46:43,284 --> 01:46:46,180
Take me on your way?

1042
01:46:46,372 --> 01:46:49,184
Take me on your way?

1043
01:47:02,584 --> 01:47:06,152
Just a little cold blue

1044
01:47:06,248 --> 01:47:07,044
steel?

1045
01:47:10,264 --> 01:47:13,992
I feel the way I want to feel? There's a

1046
01:47:14,128 --> 01:47:17,856
raging fire in my heart tonight?

1047
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:21,792
Tonight? Growing higher and higher

1048
01:47:21,928 --> 01:47:23,484
in my soul?

1049
01:48:15,444 --> 01:48:35,596
Save me,

1050
01:48:35,780 --> 01:48:39,384
I win across the sky?

1051
01:48:44,814 --> 01:48:46,914
Take me on your mind?

1052
01:48:47,894 --> 01:48:50,674
Take me on your way?

1053
01:48:57,014 --> 01:49:00,718
Make you take me out your

1054
01:49:00,766 --> 01:49:08,134
mind? With God know?

1055
01:49:09,114 --> 01:49:12,922
Take me on your mind? Take me

1056
01:49:12,978 --> 01:49:14,974
out my way?
